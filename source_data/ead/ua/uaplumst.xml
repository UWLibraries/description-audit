      <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
      <p>Plummer Stewart was born on July 13, 1870 in Union County, North Carolina. His parents were
        Robert and Sallie Stewart, and his father was a confederate veteran. Stewart graduated from
        Trinity College in 1894. He became a member of the Charlotte bar in 1901 and was at one time
        a law partner of Judge John A. Parker, Judge William H. Bobbitt, James O. Moore, and Robert
        P. Stewart. In 1913, he was a member of the North Carolina General Assembly from Mecklenburg
        County. Before moving to Charlotte, Stewart was superintendent of public instruction in
        Union County and served as principals of two schools. He died in 1951.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
      <p>The collection includes two ledgers and a small tablet. The tablet contains an itemized
        list of the expenses he incurred while a student at Trinity College. The ledgers contain
        handwritten memoirs of Stewart's life. Several pages in one ledger were removed prior to its
        donation to the Archives. Handwritten on the inside of both covers of the ledger is
        "Stewart, McRae and Bobbitt, 400-404 Law Building, Charlotte, NC." The removed pages may
        have contained information pertinent to the law firm and thus their removal. On one of the
        pages in his ledger, Stewart wrote in 1931, "I sent the little book to Prof. R. L. Flowers
        to be placed in Archives of Duke University." </p>
      <p> Also donated with these items were four oratorical prize yellow gold medals:</p>
      <p> Columbian Literary Society, Trinity College - Praemium Disputationi, June 1893</p>
      <p> Columbian Literary Society, Trinity College - Praemium Oratori, June 1894</p>
      <p> Senior Class, 1894</p>
      <p> North Carolina Teachers Assembly, 1894</p>
      <p> These items were placed in relic boxes and stored with other relics in the custody of the
        Archives.</p>
      <p> The collection ranges in date from 1892-1948. </p>

              unknown, but may have been intended for use in Stewart's law practice. In 1945,
              Stewart wrote his memoirs in the ledger. He wrote about his birth, his childhood,
              going to school, going to college, practicing law, teaching and getting married. He
              also wrote about his wife's death and his love for her. Clipped inside the ledger is
              the 1896 commencement program for Marshville Academy, of which Stewart was
              principal.</extent></physdesc>
