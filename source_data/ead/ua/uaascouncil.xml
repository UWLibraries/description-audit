            established at Duke University in July 1991, when the Undergraduate Faculty Council of
            Arts and Sciences disbanded and reconstituted itself to include some aspects of graduate
            studies and research initiatives. The Arts and Sciences Council is elected by the Arts
            and Sciences faculty and serves as this faculty's primary institution for faculty
            governance. The Council also determines and implements the broad objectives of
            undergraduate education and considers all matters affecting the academic and residential
            environments of students, making recommendations and adopting regulations where
            appropriate. Records include correspondence, reports, minutes, memoranda,
            questionnaires, and other materials documenting the activities of the A &amp; S Council.
            The bulk of the materials were generated by the Curriculum Review Committee, circa
            1992-1999. The collection also features records created by several other committees,
            including Academic Affairs, Academic Standards, Financial Aid, Residential Life, and
            Senior Year. English.</abstract>

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The Arts and Sciences Council (A &amp; S Council) was established 1 July 1991, when the
            Undergraduate Faculty Council of Arts and Sciences (UFCAS) disbanded and reconstituted
            itself; the Arts and Sciences Council first met on September 12, 1991. Its purposes
            include representing the faculty and advising the deans of Arts and Sciences with
            particular respect to Trinity College. The A &amp; S Council retained UFCAS's functions,
            but added other matters to its purview, including some aspects of graduate studies and
            research initiatives. The Executive Committee of the Arts and Sciences Council
            established four ad hoc committees and recommended to Deans White and Gillis
            appointments to the following committees: Committee on Facilities, Committee to Review
            Study Abroad, Curriculum Review Committee, and the Committee on the Teaching of Korean
            Languages. Since 1991, some of these committees have been disbanded or re-organized, and
            new committees have been formed.</p>
         <p>In 2005, the Arts and Sciences council provided the following description of its purpose
            on its website: "The Arts and Sciences Council is elected by the Arts and Sciences
            faculty and serves as this faculty's primary institution for faculty governance. The
            purposes of the Council are to represent the faculty and advise the Deans of Arts and
            Sciences and Trinity College with respect to: Arts and Sciences priorities; faculty
            development; support and policy for faculty research, teaching, and administrative
            facilities; organization of departments and units within the Arts and Sciences faculty;
            areas of interaction between graduate and undergraduate programs such as teaching
            assistantships, instructional budgets, and teacher training; and any other matters of
            particular concern to the Arts and Sciences faculty. With particular respect to Trinity
            College, the Council determines and implements the broad objectives of undergraduate
            education and considers all matters affecting the academic and residential environments
            of students, making recommendations and adopting regulations where appropriate. The
            Council meets monthly during the academic year."</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Arts and Sciences Council records include correspondence, reports, minutes, memoranda,
            questionnaires, and other materials documenting the activities of the A&amp;S Council.
            The bulk of the materials were generated by the Curriculum Review Committee, circa
            1992-1999. In 1992 Dean Richard White appointed the Curriculum Review Committee to
            evaluate the undergraduate curriculum. The records of the committee document its
            processes of studying the curriculum as well as its evaluation and recommendations.
            Surveys concerning the curriculum, which were completed by faculty as well as juniors
            and seniors are included. Curriculum issues reflected in the records include the
            Undergraduate Writing Course, requirements for academic majors, the division of the
            curriculum into six areas of knowledge, and academic advising. Copies of earlier
            curriculum studies, <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Structure and Choice in
               Liberal Education</title> (1986) and <title type="simple" render="doublequote">A
               Climate for Liberal Learning</title> (1980), are included. </p>
         <p>The collection also features records created by several other committees, including
            Academic Affairs, Academic Standards, Financial Aid, Residential Life, and Senior Year.
