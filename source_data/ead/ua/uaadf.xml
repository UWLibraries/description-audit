      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The American Dance Festival (ADF) is committed to serving the needs of dance, dancers,
        choreographers and professionals in dance-related fields. Remaining true to the goals of its
        founding artists, ADF's programs are developed based on its mission to: encourage and
        support the creation of new modern dance work by both established and emerging
        choreographers; preserve our modern dance heritage through continued presentation of classic
        works, as well as through archival efforts; build wider national and international audiences
        for modern dance; enhance public understanding and appreciation of the art form and its
        cultural and historical significance; provide a sound scientific/aesthetic base for
        professional education and training of young dancers and a forum for integrating and
        disseminating information on dance education. </p>
      <p> In July 1934, the small town of Bennington, Vermont became the site of the Bennington
        School of Dance -- the precursor of the American Dance Festival. It was the laboratory in
        which four of the great modern dance second-generation pioneers (Martha Graham, Hanya Holm,
        Doris Humphrey, and Charles Weidman) could experiment, train students, and create the early
        works that made modern dance one of the great cultural triumphs of the twentieth century. </p>
      <p> The Festival, directed by Martha Hill and Mary Josephine Shelly, remained in Bennington
        until 1942 (with a one-year sojourn to Mills College, California, in 1939). Despite the
        onset of World War II, Martha Graham spent the summers of 1943-1945 in residence in
        Bennington, and in 1946 Jos Limn brought his first company to Bennington. In 1947, Martha
        Hill initiated a pilot program at Connecticut College in New London, Connecticut, for dance
        teachers, college dance groups, and young dancers. Due to the success of that pilot program,
        the Connecticut College School of Dance/American Dance Festival opened officially in 1948.
        For the 1969 season the name became simply the American Dance Festival, and has been
        directed by Charles L. Reinhart ever since. In 1978, the ADF took over the sprawling green
        lawns, studios, offices, and dormitories of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.</p>
