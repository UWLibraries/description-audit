         <p>Paull Franklin Baum was born in Dover, Delaware on May 13, 1886. He was educated at
            Hamilton College and received a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1915. He also studied
            at the Universities of Munich, Vienna, Lausanne, and the Sorbonne. Professor Baum taught
            at Harvard until coming to Duke University in 1922.</p>
         <p> As one of the original members of the Council on Graduate Studies, he took an active
            part in establishing Duke's Graduate School. As Chairman of the Library Council, he
            helped to shape the policies of acquisition which have made the University's library one
            of the largest and most important collections of research materials in the Southeast. As
            Editorial Director of the Duke Press from 1926-1928, he aided in making plans governing
            this agency for the publication of scholarly books and periodicals. His distinction as a
            scholar and his contributions to the University were officially honored in 1953 when Dr.
            Baum was selected as one the original group of Duke faculty members to be designated a
            James B. Duke Professor, the highest academic rank at the institution. </p>
         <p> He was an honored member of the Medieval Academy of America, the Modern Language
            Association, the Modern Humanities Research Association, the Authors' Club of London,
            and the Cosmos Club of Washington, DC. He was an internationally famed scholar in the
            field of medieval and Victorian studies and was considered an authority in the
            principles of English versification and the works of Chaucer, Rossetti, Tennyson and
            Matthew Arnold. Dr. Baum authored numerous books, including a translation of the
            Anglo-Saxon riddles of the Exeter book, <title type="simple" render="italic">Tennyson
               Sixty Years After</title>, and <title type="simple" render="italic">Ten Studies in
               the Poetry of Matthew Arnold</title>. Professor Baum died in Durham, NC on July 15,
            1964.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
         <p>Contains correspondence, a manuscript, clippings, research material and book reviews by
            or to Dr. Baum. The correspondence includes two letters from Mrs. Helen Rossetti Angeli,
            daughter of William M. Rossetti, and Archibald Henderson. The latter's letter is in
            response to Baum's review of his biography of George Bernard Shaw. Henderson makes an
            interesting statement about Shaw's opposition to much that he included in the biography,
            especially two chapters which Shaw tried unsuccessfully to persuade Henderson to leave
            out of the book. Dates range from 1928-1989.</p>
