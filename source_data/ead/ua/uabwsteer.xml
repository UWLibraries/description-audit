      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>taken from the Executive Summary of the Black on White Final Report (February 1989)</p>
      <p>The Black on White Steering Committee was appointed by Malcolm-Gillis, Vice-Provost for
        Academic Affairs and Dean of the Graduate School. Its composition consisted of key faculty,
        student leaders, administrators, and staff whose purpose was to gather institutional support
        for a university-wide symposium that would address specifically the kind of environment
        provided for black students at Duke. </p>
      <p>The symposium titled "Black on White: An Exploration of the Issues Surrounding the
        Experience of Black Students on White Campuses" was held October 24-25, 1988. The primary
        goal of this symposium was to look at the issues surrounding the experiences of black
        students on white campuses, and how Duke as an educational institution can create a more
        supportive environment for minorities. The symposium was designed to lay the groundwork and
        initiate the dialogue to: (1) increase awareness of the prevailing values, attitudes, and
        prejudices regarding black/white issues on Duke's campus; and (2) increase sensitivity to
        the effects that racial misperceptions have on the quality of campus life for all students.
