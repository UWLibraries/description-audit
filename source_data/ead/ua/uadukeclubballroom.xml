      <p>Duke Ballroom Dance Club (DBDC) is a student organization specializing in the American
        style of Rhythm and Smooth ballroom dances including waltz, tango, foxtrot, Viennese waltz,
        rumba, cha-cha, swing, and more. DBDC hosts open ballroom social classes twice a month, and
        beginner and advanced ballroom lessons twice a week for club members. Throughout the year,
        DBDC members compete in at least five local, regional and national competitions, and perform
        in dance showcases around campus. Professional coaches, including Jonathan Medlin, Malin
        Allert, and Andy Carlson help members prepare for events.</p>
      <p>The group was formed in 2017 by graduate students, Sijia Wei, Peter Horvath, Anne Draelos,
        and Mark Draelos. Along with students Angel Shi, Wendy Dong, and Amelia Bell, they performed
        partner dances from varying cultures both socially and competitively. DBDC's first
        performance was at WorlDuke in Spring 2018, where the new group attended its first regional
        ballroom dance competition and won awards. In the next two years, the club participated in
        five showcases, four local competitions, and a national competition, ranking 8th place
        nationally. After three years, the group officially became a part of Duke Sport Clubs,
        changing its identity to Duke Club Ballroom Dance (DCBD).</p>
