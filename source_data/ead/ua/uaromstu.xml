      <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
      <p>The Department of Romance Languages first appears in the Trinity College Bulletin in the
        1903-1904 academic year. The language of primary interest was French. Before the development
        of the Department of Romance Languages there was an individual language department for
        French with Spanish being offered to seniors desiring an elementary understanding of the
        language. Currently (2006) the title for the department is Department of Romance Studies and
        it offers a variety of comprehensive undergraduate programs-from beginning language courses
        to minors and majors-in French and Francophone Studies, Italian Studies, and Spanish and
        Latin American Studies. Portuguese is taught as a language program only. The department also
        offers comprehensive PhD programs in French and Francophone Studies and in Spanish and Latin
        American Studies, as well as a Romance Studies PhD track that allows qualified graduate
        students to combine two Romance languages in their PhD studies.</p>
