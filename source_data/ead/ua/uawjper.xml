      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Walter Scott "Jack" Persons began his coaching career with the Duke Swim team while still
        an undergraduate in 1931. At the age of 20, he was the youngest head coach at any major
        university in the United States. Parsons went on to graduate in 1933, but retained his
        coaching position. During his 45-year career, his teams celebrated 207 meet victories and
        undefeated seasons in 1933 and 1939. Persons is recognized as one of the pioneers of
        swimming in North Carolina and served for many years as Chair of the Durham County Red Cross
        life saving and water safety units.</p>
      <p>Persons became head coach of a second varsity sport in 1940, following the graduation of
        the player/coach of the Duke Lacrosse team. Persons held the lacrosse coaching position
        until 1966; during that time, he produced several All-Americans and led Duke to upset
        victories over traditional national powers such as Johns Hopkins and Navy. The highlight
        came in 1946 when Duke shocked national power Maryland, 12-4 in one of the greatest upsets
        in collegiate lacrosse history. Under Persons's direction, Duke Lacrosse was consistently
        ranked as one of the nation's top teams.</p>
      <p>Persons retired from coaching in 1975 and was honored with election to the Duke Sports Hall
        of Fame in 1986. He also held an unbroken streak of 72 years of perfect attendance at Duke
        home football games until the fall of 2003 when he missed one game. He passed away in 2005
        at the age of 96. </p>
