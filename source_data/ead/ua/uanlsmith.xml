      <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
      <p>Nancy Lee Smith graduated in 1950 from Washington High School, located in her hometown of
        Washington, N.C. She entered the Woman's College at Duke University as a freshman that fall
        and lived in Brown House. Smith received full tuition scholarships and earned a place on the
        Dean's List each year.</p>
      <p> In the Methodist Student Fellowship, she served as community chairman from 1950-1951 and
        as vice president in 1952. In 1953, she was elected President of the North Carolina
        Conference Methodist Youth Fellowship. She attended the United Nations-Washington Seminar as
        a delegate of the Youth Fellowship in 1953. </p>
      <p> Smith was active in student government and was elected to serve as vice president of the
        Duke University Women's Student Government Association and was also tapped by Phi Kappa
        Delta, an honorary leadership society. As an exemplary representative of Duke students, she
        was selected to serve as a Commencement marshal for the spring 1953 ceremonies. </p>

      <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
      <p>Contains photographs, correspondence, report cards, postcards, playbooks, programs,
        invitations, telegrams, and clippings. These items were originally included in a scrapbook
        created by Nancy Lee Smith. The scrapbook was about 100 pages long and contained general
        items which reflected Smith's religious, social, and academic life at Duke University from
        1950 to 1954, and one letter from 1956. Because the original scrapbook was in poor
        condition, items were removed and placed in archival folders for preservation.</p>
