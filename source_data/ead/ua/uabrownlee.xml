         <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
         <p>Anna Kathryn "Kay" Brownlee was born in 1912 in Philadelphia, Pa. She graduated from
            Frankford High School of Philadelphia, Pa. in 1930 and enrolled at Duke that fall. She
            was a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma and active in the campus YMCA and dormitory
            governance. Her brother, John Hubert Brownlee, was also a student at Duke and player on
            the football team. A devoted fan of Duke football, Kay followed the career of Horace
            "Horse" Hendrickson, a star player from 1932 to 1933. Though Kay was an involved
            student, she did not graduate from Duke University, possibly due to the Depression.</p>
         <p>Kay pursued a career in retail sales in Philadelphia, Pa. with Dewees Department Store
            during the 1930s. As a personnel manager with Dewees, she directed employees in dress,
            conduct, policy administration, schedules, and sales promotions. She often traveled to
            New York City and Philadelphia to represent the store. In June 1942 she married F.
            Clifford Scherer. The Scherers were members of The First Presbyterian Church of Olney of
            Philadelphia, Pa., where Kay taught Sunday School for ten years. Kay continued to work
            with Dewees Department stores until their closing. She died in 1971. </p>

         <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
         <p>Contains photographs, correspondence, artwork, receipts, report cards, class schedules,
            a plaque, patches, letters, cards, playbooks, programs, invitations, telegrams, and
            clippings. These items were originally included in scrapbooks created by Anna Kathryn
            Brownlee. The first scrapbook was about 100 pages long and contained general items which
            reflected Anna Kathryn Brownlee's active social and academic life at Duke University
            from 1930 to 1933. The second scrapbook was about 75 pages long and was devoted entirely
            to Duke University football events. Because the original scrapbooks were in poor
            condition, items were removed and placed in archival folders for preservation.</p>
