         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Norman Underwood was the contractor in charge of the construction of the Trinity College
            Library. He was born in Ohio on September 2, 1862 and moved to Durham, N.C. in about
            1897. Having worked in construction for many years, he started his own contracting firm
            in 1901. In addition to the library building, he contracted for several other buildings
            for Trinity College, including Craven Memorial Hall and the West Duke Building, as well
            as several buildings in Durham and for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
            Active in civic duties, Mr. Underwood married Elsie E. Ward of Ohio and had five
            children: May Almina Underwood Rigsbee, Norman Bruce, Harrison Aubrey, Daniel Maurice,
            and Robert Ward. He died on June 17, 1930.</p>
         <p>The Trinity College Library was built in 1901 and 1902. Prior to that time, the Library
            did not have a dedicated building and instead housed books and a reading room in a
            shared building. In 1900, James Buchanan Duke gave the college some money to build a
            library, following Benjamin Duke's gift for a library endowment the previous year.
            Ground was broken for the new building in July 1901 and it was expected to be complete
            by the end of the school year. The winter of 1901-1902 was a hard winter for building,
            and the completion of the building was delayed until December 1902. Over the Christmas
            holidays, the books, numbering about 11,000 volumes, were moved from the old library
            into the new building. The building was formally opened on February 23, 1903. In 1927,
            preparations began to move the library to the new West Campus. By then the books
            numbered about 100,000, and were moved to the new Women's College Library, opened in
            March 1927, before moving to the new General Library. In an agreement with Kittrell
            College, an all-black college in Vance County, the Trinity College library building
            would be moved to the Kittrell College campus and reassembled. The move was partially
            funded by a gift from Benjamin Duke, and the newly reassembled library building at
            Kittrell was named in his honor when it opened in 1929. The B. N. Duke Library, along
            with two other buildings moved from Trinity College to Kittrell College, burned down in
            1972, and Kittrell College closed down in 1975.</p>
