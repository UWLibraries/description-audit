      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The formal study of art at Duke began with the establishment of the Dept. of Aesthetics,
        Art, and Music in 1942, with Prof. Katherine E. Gilbert as chair. The department was renamed
        the Dept. of Art in the 1959/1960 academic year, and later renamed the Dept. of Art and Art
        History in 1985/1986.</p>
      <p>In 2005, the Dept. of Art and Art History provided the following description of its
        mission: "The Department of Art &amp; Art History, as its name implies, has two distinct yet
        profoundly complementary units, one primarily devoted to the making of works of art, the
        other primarily devoted to the historical understanding and current interpretation of visual
        images and constructed space ... Since 1986, the Department broadened its perspective by
        introducing courses in theory, methodology, and criticism; by attracting faculty specialists
        in African and African Diaspora, East Asian, and Latin American art histories in addition to
        ... European and North American art, from ancient times to [the] contemporary world; and by
        interacting through interdisciplinary teaching, collaborative research and symposia with
        other departments and programs, such as African and African-American Studies, Economics,
        English, Women's Studies, the Center for Documentary Studies and the Center for French and
        Francophone Studies." [http://www.duke.edu/web/art/welcome.html]</p>
