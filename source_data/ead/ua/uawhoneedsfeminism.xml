      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Who Needs Feminism started as a class project for Women in the Public Sphere: History,
        Theory, and Practice in Spring 2012. The class, taught by Dr. Rachel Seidman and made up of
        sixteen women students, began a campaign with posters around campus and photographs on
        social media depicting people of varying gender and ethnicity holding white board signs with
        the text "I need feminism because ..." and describing different reasons for supporting
        feminism, with the text WHO NEEDS FEMINISM across the top. Posters were hung around campus
        and the students wrote an editorial for the Chronicle on April 12, 2012
        (http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2012/04/who-needs-feminism). The campaign also
        included pages on Facebook and Tumblr, which allowed members of the Duke community and the
        public to post their own pictures and comments.</p>
      <p>The campaign was designed to draw attention to misconceptions about feminism and who is a
        feminist as well as to promote discussion about the importance of feminism in everyday life.
        The campaign's pages on Facebook and Tumblr quickly acquired thousands of views, likes, and
        posts; by May 9, 2012, whoneedsfeminism.tumblr.com had received more than 91,000 visits. As
        of November 2016, the Facebook page (www.facebook.com/WhoNeedsFeminism) had more than 39,000
        likes, and the Tumblr account had more than 4,500 posts. The campaign also spread to other
        colleges and universities as well as groups and organizations around the world, and the Duke
        group created a start-up guide to support these efforts.</p>
      <p>The campaign also generated negative reactions, including vandalizing or tearing down the
        original posters on campus and widespread backlash via social media comments and
        submissions. A campaign called Women Against Feminism used the original campaign's structure
        of individuals holding up signs stating "I don't need feminism ..."</p>
