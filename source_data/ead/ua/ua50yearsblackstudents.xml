        American undergraduates in September, 1963. In 2013, the University held a year-long
        celebration called Commemorating 50 Years of Black Students at Duke with a variety of
        academic, artistic, and service-oriented events. The collection includes programs,
        brochures, clippings, materials kept by Staff Director of the commemoration Keith Daniel,
        reflections written by alumni, and interviews with some of the first black undergraduate
        students recorded in 2012.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Duke University was racially segregated until 1961. In September of 1961, the first African
        American students were admitted into graduate programs in the Law School and Divinity
        School. In September 1963, the first five African American undergraduate students enrolled:
        Mary Mitchell Harris, Gene Kendall, Wilhelmina Reuben-Cooke, Cassandra Smith Rush, and
        Nathaniel White, Jr. In 1967, Harris, Reuben-Cooke, and White became the first African
        American students to earn undergraduate degrees from Duke. </p>
      <p>In 2012, plans began for events to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the admission of
        black students to Duke in 2013. The commemoration was a year-long celebration of diversity
        and inclusion, branded as Commemorating 50 Years of Black Students at Duke, also referred to
        as the 50th Anniversary Commemoration. The leadership team for Commemorating 50 Years
        included Ben Reese (Vice President for Institutional Equity), Sterly Wilder (Associate Vice
        President for Alumni Affairs), Mike Schoenfeld (Vice President for Public Affairs and
        Government Relations); Keith Daniel, former Director of Community and Campus Engagement for
        Duke Chapel, was appointed staff director for the commemoration. An Executive Committee, an
        Advisory Committee, and a National Committee, made up of faculty, students, and
        administrators, were also appointed to work on the commemoration. </p>
      <p>Commemorating 50 Years of Black Students at Duke University officially kicked off with a
        reception at the Nasher Museum of Art on January 25, 2013. Events throughout the year
        included a Durham/Duke event focused on civil rights at the Durham Performing Arts Center,
        an academic symposium led by faculty from the African and African-American Studies
        Department, musical performances, alumni reunions, regional events for Duke alumni in cities
        across the United States (including New York City, Chicago, Atlanta, and Los Angeles) and a
        closing ceremony during Founders' Day weekend in the fall of 2013. </p>
