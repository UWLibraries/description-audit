         <p> Born in Whitesboro, Texas, John Leon Lievsay (1906-1992) was educated at the University
            of Washington (B.A., 1926; M.A., 1932; Ph.D., 1937). After teaching at Stanford
            University and the University of Tennessee, Lievsay came to Duke University in 1962 as a
            Professor of English. He was a James B. Duke Professor of English from 1970 until his
            retirement in 1975.</p>
         <p>Lievsay's specialty was sixteenth and seventeenth century literature, with an emphasis
            on Anglo-Italian relations. He was a research fellow at the Huntington, Newberry, and
            Folger Libraries, as well as a Fulbright Fellow in Italy (1953-1954) and a Guggenheim
            Fellow (1968-1969). Lievsay was a special consultant in Italian at the Folger Library
            (1959-1960); chairman of the Southeastern Institute of Medieval and Renaissance Studies;
            and a member of the Renaissance Society of America, the Dante Society, and the American
            Association of Teachers of Italian. </p>
