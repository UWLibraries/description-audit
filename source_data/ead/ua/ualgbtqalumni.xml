            <p>David Anderson was raised in Raleigh, North Carolina. He attended Duke between 1985
              and 1989 as an Angier B. Duke (AB) Scholar. He co-founded the reconstituted Duke Gay
              and Lesbian Association (DGLA, later Duke Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Association,
              Gothic Queers, Alliance of Queer Undergraduates [AQUADuke], and Blue Devils United).
              He also participated in Hoof 'n' Horn and Duke Chapel Choir. He currently runs a music
              business in Raleigh. Anderson is interviewed twice by different interviewers. In
              multiple interviews, Anderson talks about his family background. Anderson also
              discusses discovering his sexuality during his first year at Duke, and the prolonged
              process of coming out. Of note is his discussion about his isolation and the lack of
              resources for gay students at Duke at the time. Although the DGLA existed at the time,
              Anderson discusses its secretive nature during his first years at Duke and how this
              and other events factored into making rechartering the organization as an open and
              visible presence in 1988. He further describes the fears around openness and some of
              DGLA's public activities. He describes casual homophobia he experienced at Duke. Also
              discussed are the differences between Duke and Durham's environment for LGBTQ people,
              the importance of mentorship to LGBTQ young people in the late 1980s, and how the Duke
              community reacted to the HIV/AIDS crisis. Also included are a formal paper by Anderson
              describing his experience at the first Blue Jeans Day in 1988 as well as his personal
              notes created in preparation for the oral history interview.</p>

            <p>Christopher Bragg was born in Elon, North Carolina. He studied psychology at Duke
              University, graduating in 1990. During his undergraduate years at Duke, Bragg worked
              in research labs at Duke Medicine and served as a peer counselor. Bragg continued his
              education at UNC-Chapel Hill where he attained a Ph. D. in neuroscience. In 2000,
              Bragg moved to Boston to complete a post doctorate at Harvard. As of 2016, Bragg runs
              a laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital. In this oral history, Bragg describes
              on his early family life. He discusses LGBTQ progress at Duke during the late 1980s,
              comparing, throughout, the environment at Duke to that at Yale, as well as to Durham
              and Chapel Hill, and finally to Boston and Harvard. Bragg also describes the creation
              and fostering of community during this time by the Duke Gay and Lesbian Association
              (DGLA). Bragg also mentions the pushback from some to the increasing visibility of
              LGBTQ people at Duke. Also described is the differences in experience between the men
              and women in DGLA. Bragg talks about sexual expression as an undergraduate and how it
              was affected by the HIV/AIDS crisis.</p>

            <p>Daniel Ellison grew up in New York and Miami before attending college at Duke
              University, from where he graduated in 1977. He later received graduate degrees in

              broader culture at Duke in the mid-1970s. Ellison talks about his own sexual identity
              as one of ambivalence during his years at Duke. Ellison discusses the differences
              between LGBTQ life during his student years at Duke and the LGBTQ life he observes as
              an adjunct professor and involved faculty member. Also discusses is activism around
              LGBTQ rights in Durham and the surrounding area.</p>

            <p>Meredith Emmett graduated from Duke University in 1982 with a degree in Mechanical
              Engineering. She likes to say that she “majored in activism and minored in
              engineering,” due to her involvement with the North Carolina Policy Interest Research
              Group (NC PIRG). Following graduation, she began working as a carpenter. Emmett has
              worked in energy conservation and served as the director of three non-profit
              organizations. As of 2016, Emmett lives in Durham and works as coach and trainer for
              non-profits. In this oral history, Emmett discusses her activism on campus. Emmett
              talks about the difference between issue- and identity-based activism, and that her
              years at Duke saw more issue movements than identity movements. Other topics include
              how the HIV/AIDS epidemic affected Emmett personally, mentors Karl Wittman and Allen
              Troxler, organizing a gay pride march in the early 1980s, and her experience with
              Pride PAC (later Equality NC).</p>

            <p>Kelly Jarrett attended Duke in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and later worked for
              the university until 2014. At Duke, Jarrett was an instructor in the Department of
              Religion, an assitant managing editor at Duke University Press, and an administrator
              in the Duke Islamic Studies Center. She was a founding member of the Old West Durham
              Neighborhood Association, which was formed after a series of race, gender, and sexual
              orientation-based aggressions against her and her partner. In this oral history,
              Jarrett describes her gender and sexual identity, her life in the Midwest, Northeast,
              and Southeast, and her current work. She contrasts her experiences with the
              relationship between Duke and Durham with those at Yale and New Haven. She also speaks
              of the differences between the graduate and undergraduate student life in terms of
              LGBTQ identity. Also discussed are the institutional issues regarding the treatement
              of and respect for sexual, gender, and racial minorities.</p>

            <p>Tim Koch attended Duke from 1979 to 1983, and later attended Boston University and

            <p>Steve Ritchie attended Duke in the late 1980s, graduating in 1990, and later earned
              an Masters in Business Administration from Dartmouth. Though not out during his time

              Day and other campus events increasing LGBTQ visibility at the university. As of 2016,
              Ritchie lived and worked in Seattle, Washington. In this oral history, Ritchie
              discusses his upbringing in the rural Midwest, his experience at Duke in the 1980s,
              and his experiences since moving on from Duke. He contrasts his experience at Duke and
              Dartmouth, and contextualizes many of his specific observations by discussing the

              and from 1986-1990. She has lived in Durham, North Carolina since then, working a
              variety of jobs including food service, the Duke Women's Center, the Durham Food
              Co-Op, and LadySlipper. As of 2016, she is curator for the Women's Veterans History

            <p>Dr. Jerome Smith was born in Trenton, New Jersey. He attended Duke in the late 1980s,
              graduating from the Pratt School of Engineering in 1990. At Duke, he was active in the
              Duke Chapel Choir and various theatre groups. He later earned his medical degree from
              George Washington University. As of 2016, Smith lives and works in Sonoma, California.
              In this oral history, Smith discusses the development of his sexual identity. Smith
              describes viewing his desire for having and raising children as mutually exclusive
              from being an out gay man. He also describes his impressions of Durham's intolerance
              and his lack of awareness of Durham LGBTQ communities. In comparing experiences as a
              Duke student to those as a medical student at George Washington, Smith describes
              experiencing discrimination at the latter, which he attributes to being out during
              this time whereas he was closeted at Duke.</p>

            <p>Katherine Turner attended Duke from 1986-1990. While at Duke, Turner was active with
              the Peer Information Service for Counseling and Education in Sexuality (PISCES)

              writing for the Duke Women's Handbook, and pushback from other student groups. Turner

              transgender community on campus. Also described are queer spaces in the Durham
              community, LGBTQ-specific events at Duke and in Durham, and stigma around the gay
              community and AIDS. Turner later describes her current connection to Duke and how the
