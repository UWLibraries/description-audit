      <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
      <p>The Duke University Woman's College opened in the fall of 1930 as part of the expansion of
        Trinity College into Duke University. In 1924 James B. Duke established the Duke Endowment
        and gave funds to transform a small liberal arts college into a major university. From 1925
        to 1927 the existing Trinity Campus (now Duke's East Campus) was rebuilt and transformed to
        become a residential campus for undergraduate women. From 1928 to 1930 Duke's new gothic
        West Campus and residential campus for undergraduate male students was constructed and known
        as Trinity College for Men. In 1972, the Men's and Women's colleges were merged to form
        Trinity College of Arts and Sciences.</p>
      <p>In the Fall of 2002, the Woman's College marked the 30th anniversary of its merger with the
        Trinity College for Men with a reunion. Carolyn Murray Happer, Class of 1960, curated an
        exhibition on the history of Woman's College and decided to start an oral history interview
        project with alumnae for use in a proposed history of Woman's College. </p>

      <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
      <p>Carolyn Murray Happer interviewed nine alumnae who graduated from the period of 1931 to
        1947. Her goal was to document the experiences and perceptions of women who attended Duke
        University during this period. In particular she wanted to know why they selected and how
        the Woman's College figured into that decision. She also explored her subject's position and
        negative experiences at Duke. Her interviewees include several class leaders, a member of
        the Duke family, and others who have had long established ties to the school after
        graduation.</p>
