            North Carolina and a student at Duke University from 1931 to 1935. In 1931, Long and ten
            other Duke freshmen formed the Duke Collegians Orchestra, later the Johnny Long
            Orchestra. Long and the Orchestra recorded several hits and performed at jazz venues
            around the country. Long continued to perform until his death in 1972. The scrapbook
            contains photographs, clippings, gig posters and advertisements, album liner notes, and

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Johnny Long was born September 12, 1914 in Newell, North Carolina to Curtis W. and
            Connie Gardner Long. According to popular legend, at the age of two, imitating an older
            cousin, Long put his right hand into a hog's mouth in an attempt to feed him and in the
            process received a damaging bite. Consequently, when Long picked up the violin as a
            teenager, it was the beginning of his career as one of the few accomplished left-handed
            violinists.</p>
         <p>After finishing school at Charlotte Central High in 1931, Long came to Duke University
            and shortly thereafter formed the Duke Collegians with ten other freshmen. In addition
            to being the nightly entertainment at University Unions, the Duke Collegians played gigs
            throughout the triangle and were the summer house band at White Lake Beach, North
            Carolina. After graduating in 1935, the Duke Collegians became known as the Johnny Long
            Orchestra. In 1942, the orchestra played an extended engagement at the Roseland Ballroom
            and the New Yorker Hotel in New York City. They also performed dates at other well-known
            jazz locations such as Frank Dailey's in Newark, New Jersey, the William Penn Hotel in
            Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and the College Inn and Trianon Ballroom in Chicago, Illinois.
            The band's first label release was <emph render="italic">Just Like That</emph> in 1937
            on Vocalion Records, a label owned by American Record Coporation (ARC). The band signed
            to Decca Records in 1939 and released several hit songs including <emph render="italic"
               >In a Shanty in Old Shanty Town</emph> , written by Long, and covers of <emph
               render="italic">My Dreams Are Getting Better All the Time</emph> and <emph
               render="italic">Poor Butterfly</emph>. At the height of the band's popularity they
            played President Franklin D. Roosevelt's birthday party on February 13, 1942, an event
            attended by Roosevelt. Long also starred as himself in the 1941 Oscar nominated film
               <emph render="italic">Beauty and the Beach</emph>.</p>
         <p>During the decline of the Big Band era Long continued to play with his own band through
            1967 and fronted other bands thereafter until 1972. In 1970, Long enrolled at Marshall
            University to complete his degree, which, due to his commitment to the orchestra, he
            never completed at Duke. On October 31, 1972 Long passed away in Huntington, West
            Virginia at the age of 58 and is buried in his hometown of Newell, North Carolina.</p>
