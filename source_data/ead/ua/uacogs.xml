      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The College Organization for General Service was founded in 1943 for the purpose of
        encouraging social service and organizing war work for students of the Woman's College of
        Duke University. The idea for C.O.G.S. was realized in 1941 during meetings of the American
        Women's Voluntary Services at First Presbyterian Church in Durham, North Carolina. Mary
        Grace Wilson, Ruth Addoms, and Alice M. Baldwin represented the Woman's College at the
        meetings and became interested in starting a smaller chapter for students. Dean Wilson was
        Chair of the Duke unit of the American Women's Voluntary Services until she stepped down in
        1941 to devote more time to the Woman's College. </p>
      <p>C.O.G.S. was founded in 1941 under the leadership of Woman's College senior Barbara Jarden,
        Dean Mary Grace Wilson, and faculty member Ruth Addoms. Any female student who arrived on
        campus automatically became a member of C.O.G.S. The organization was governed by
        representatives from each women's dormitory, the Town Girl's Club, and graduate students.
        The aim of the group was to create a meaningful place for women to serve the United States
        during wartime in an "all-out-for-victory" campaign. C.O.G.S. women performed variety shows
        for soldiers, rolled bandages for the Red Cross, knitted clothing for soldiers, collected
        salvage goods, donated blood, organized war files in the Duke University Alumni office,
        collected magazines for soldiers, hosted open houses at the Woman's College for Camp Butner
        soldiers, and sold war stamps and bonds. Women who performed a certain number of service
        projects earned a C.O.G.S. Key to represent her contribution. </p>
      <p>To plan the academic training of women for war service, Dean Mary Grace Wilson corresponded
        with service organizations, potential employers, and other universities to develop a
        curriculum that would teach war-related topics. New courses developed at the Duke University
        Woman's College included: "Mathematics of Artillery Fire," "Sea Power and Modern Navies,"
        and volunteer courses in home nursing, first aid, surgical dressing, and civilian
        protection. Woman's College students were encouraged to take these courses so that they may
        be better prepared for a job in the armed forces after college.</p>
      <p>Dean Wilson supported other campus events that unified the students at Duke University.
        Sing Nights at the Woman's College were major social activities organized by the Women's
        Student Government Association. "Sings" were an opportunity for groups to lead audiences in
        easy-to-learn popular and traditional songs. These "sings" were open to all members of the
        campus community. Fraternity and sorority groups were the most frequent participants.
        Sometimes in costume, groups would perform a scripted set of songs, competing against each
        other for prizes. C.O.G.S. women participated in "sings" as well; the official C.O.G.S. song
        was written by Lucy Blue and Kay Myers in 1943. </p>
      <p> As the war came to an end, the war-related services that C.O.G.S. provided were no longer
        in need. When C.O.G.S. disbanded in March, 1946, students decided to contribute the treasury
        to the campus YWCA. Dean Mary Grace Wilson encouraged women to continue community service
        through other organizations. </p>
