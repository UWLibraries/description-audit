      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Faculty Club of Duke University is a non-stock corporation chartered by the State of
        North Carolina in 1933. Its origins date to the formation of the Faculty Club of Trinity
        College in 1918. History professor William K. Boyd served as this organization's first
        president. The club had fifteen charter members. The four core officers (president,
        vice-president, secretary, and treasurer) constituted a Board of Governors. The Board was in
        charge of elections, committees, bylaws, and finances. Club membership included active,
        associate, and honorary faculty (persons of distinction who had performed services for the
        U.S., North Carolina, or Trinity College). All faculty and officers of administration and
        instruction were eligible to join the club. </p>
      <p>The purpose of the club was to foster good fellowship among members; to contribute to their
        social life; and to promote discussion of scholarly matters as well as matters of general
        interest. In 1932 the Faculty Club proposed a plan for a university medical guild, which
        generated interest resulting in the creation of the present medical and hospital care plan
        for the faculty and staff. During the 1940s a member described the Faculty Club as the "sole
        medium through which the entire faculty meets in a social way." The organization focused on
        both leisure and intellectual concerns. Members enjoyed annual picnics, Christmas parties,
        smokers, athletic events, and other activities. They also organized and attended lectures
        about both national and international issues, and sponsored joint meetings with the Faculty
        Club of The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Two major concerns of the club were
        improving faculty-student relations and securing a permanent home. The members had been
        meeting in various locations on campus and in the University House, the former B. N. Duke
        Estate in Durham known as "Four Acres." The Nello Teer, Jr. House on Roxboro Road in Durham
        became the site of the club in 1968. This proved unsatisfactory because of the distance from
        campus, and plans were soon underway to build a new facility. The Faculty Club, completed
        around 1971, is located in Duke Forest near the University golf course.</p>

            welfare, student-faculty relations, a medical plan, and the need for a suitable
            clubhouse. The effects of World Wars One and Two on academia and the organization,
            solicitation of membership, the exclusion of women from the club, and the importance of
            gaining both usefulness and influence in the community make-up additional subjects.</p>

            questionnaire (1927) solicits personal and professional information from potential
            faculty club members, which current members used as a tool in the decision-making
            process. Another questionnaire, dated 1961, pertains to faculty interest in a club
