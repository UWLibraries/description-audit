         <p>Originally from Hillsborough, NC, Maude Turner Brown enrolled at Duke's Woman's College
            in 1924. She served as a Junior Big Sister and was active in the Y.W.C.A., serving as
            the Sophomore Representative. She was a fan of Duke's football and baseball teams and of
            its musical organizations. She attended summer school at Duke in 1926. Soon after her
            sophomore year, she transferred to the University of NC-Chapel Hill.</p>

         <p>Brown included these items in a 36-page, string-bound patent "Memory Book of College
            Life," with Duke's seal on the cover. The scrapbook focuses especially on Brown's life
            during 1924-1926 and on the general experiences of freshmen and sophomores at Trinity
            College. Loose items were placed in sleeves and protective sheets between pages
            containing three dimensional items, for preservation.</p>
