      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>SPUD (Student Project for University Development) was a student-run service organization
        dedicated to including students in the planning and development of Duke University. SPUD was
        founded in 1976 by James Paulette, a Duke University undergraduate. SPUD was governed by
        leaders from a variety of student groups on campus. </p>
      <p>With a loan of $500 from the Office of Institutional Advancement and a $100 gift from the
        Nursing School's student government, SPUD began planning its fundraising activities for
        1977. SPUD worked in cooperation with Alumni Affairs and the Office of Institutional
        Advancement (now University Development). In August 1977, the Office of Institutional
        Advancement announced a $1.5 million grant from the Kresge Foundation for the University
        Center; the grant was credited to SPUD's general enthusiasm and creativity. </p>
      <p>The three main projects that SPUD sought to fund were the Duke University Center, the East
        Campus Activity Center, and the Reggie Howard Memorial Scholarship Fund. The University
        Center was to be a new meeting place for students; the East Campus Activity Center would
        replace an extremely small gymnasium. The scholarship, named for a much-admired member of
        SPUD's Executive Committee, was intended to help minority students attend college. Both the
        University Center and the Reggie Howard Memorial Scholarship projects were completed. Some
        of SPUD's fundraising activities included art sales, a bench-a-thon (fraternity men sitting
        on a bench for 101 hours), swim-a-thons (numerous laps by the Neridians, Duke University's
        synchronized swimming team), raffles for dates with sorority women, backrub sales, radio ad
        sales, concerts, tennis tournaments, selling discount cards, and distribution of coupon
        booklets.</p>
      <p>SPUD dissolved in 1979 and was replaced by SCIAAA (Student Committee for Institutional
        Advancement and Alumni Affairs), formerly a subcommittee of SPUD. SCIAAA worked with the
        Office of Institutional Advancement (now University Development) to continue to raise funds.
        SCIAAA primarily focused on meeting with alumni and potential donors to provide a current
        perspective on student life at Duke University. </p>
