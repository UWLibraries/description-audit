      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>In July 1981, Terry Sanford initiated negotiations with former U. S. President Richard
        Nixon (Duke Law '37) to locate the Nixon presidential library on the campus of Duke
        University, Nixon's alma mater. When this information was revealed to faculty members during
        the week of August 10, 1981, many opposed the proposition, citing Sanford's failure to
        consult the faculty prior to initiating negotiations. </p>
      <p> Many who opposed the library had moral objections to memorializing a President whose
        behavior in office was reproachable, and they feared a negative effect on the university's
        reputation. Other concerns included the effects of increased tourist traffic on campus and
        the uncertain aesthetic nature of the proposed structure. However, supporters of the Nixon
        Library argued that the scholarly and academic benefits of locating the Nixon Presidential
        Materials collection on campus should and would outweigh other concerns. These supporters
        tended to denounce the actions of vocal dissenters as divisive and arrogant. </p>
      <p> Meetings of the Academic Council and Board of Trustees during September and October 1981
        were dominated by the Nixon Library debate, and a group of faculty formed the Committee
        Against the Nixon-Duke Library (CANDL) to organize the efforts of faculty, students, alumni,
        and others opposed to the proposed library. Although the Academic Council voted not to
        pursue further negotiations with former president Nixon in a 35-34 decision at a September
        3, 1981 meeting, the Board of Trustees later voted 9-2 to proceed. By April 1982,
        negotiations had stalled. One year later, Nixon's representatives announced that a site at
        Chapman College in San Clemente, California, had been chosen for the Richard M. Nixon
        Presidential Library. </p>
      <p> These files were created by Peter H. Wood, while serving as Professor in the Dept. of
        History. He is now Professor Emeritus. </p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>This collection contains correspondence, flyers, clippings, and other documents regarding
        the Nixon Library Controversy at Duke during 1981. The documentation was created and/or
        collected by Dept. of History Professor, Peter H. Wood, and demonstrates the divisiveness of
        this controversy as well as the opinions of Duke faculty members regarding the Nixon
        library.</p>
