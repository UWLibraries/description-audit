      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Frederick Adolphus Wolf served as a James B. Duke Professor of Botany at Duke University
        from 1927 until his retirement in 1956. He was born in Odell, Nebraska in 1885, and received
        his bachelor's degree (1907) and master's degree (1908) from the University of Nebraska.
        After teaching botany at the University of Texas for three years, Wolf earned his Ph.D. from
        Cornell University in 1911. </p>
      <p> His early career included plant pathology research work at the Alabama Agricultural
        Experiment Station and at the North Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station. He joined the
        Botany faculty at Duke University in 1927. In 1965, he received the North Carolina Gold
        Medal, the state's highest honor, which recognized him for his research with tobacco. Two
        years later, the Kentucky Commissioner of Agriculture honored Wolf for his contributions to
        the tobacco industry. In 1968, Wolf was given the Fellow Award of the Department of Plant
        Pathology of the American Phytopathological Society, and in 1970, he was named one of
        Tobacco's Men of the Year. </p>
      <p> Wolf's research focused on aromatic tobacco, and he discovered that the aroma came from
        living hairs covering both sides of the plant's leaves. He was a member of the American
        Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Phytopathological Society, and the
        Botanical Society of America. He authored numerous scholarly articles and several books,
        including <title type="simple" render="italic">The Fungi: An introduction to their structure
          and classification</title> (1947), <title type="simple" render="italic">Tobacco Diseases
          and Decays</title> (1957), and <title type="simple" render="italic">Aromatic or Oriental
          Tobaccos</title> (1962). Frederick Wolf died in 1975, at age 90.</p>
