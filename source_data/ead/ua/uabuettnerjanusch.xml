      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>John Buettner-Janusch was a professor at Duke University in the 1960s who was convicted of
        manufacturing illegal drugs in his New York University laboratory in the 1970s and of
        sending poisoned candy to a federal judge and another Duke professor in 1987.</p>
      <p>John Buettner-Janusch was born on December 7, 1924 in Chicago. He graduated from the
        University of Chicago with a BS in 1949 and an MA in 1953, then completed a PhD in
        anthropology at the University of Michigan in 1957. He married Vina Mallowitz in 1950.
        Buettner-Janusch was a professor of anthropology at Yale University from 1957-1965, when he
        joined the Duke University faculty. He brought with him a colony of 90 lemurs and founded
        the Duke University Primate Center, now called the Duke Lemur Center. While on the faculty
        at Duke, he served on the University Planning Committee from 1971-1972, chairing the
        Sub-Committee on Faculty Development. In 1973, he left Duke to become the head of the
        anthropology department at New York University. Throughout his career, he published numerous
        articles and the anthropology textbook "Origins of Man". Vina Mallowitz, his wife and
        collaborator, died in 1977. </p>
      <p>In 1977, Buettner-Janusch was accused of manufacturing illegal drugs including LSD and
        methaqualone in his laboratory with the aid of student assistants. He claimed he was
        innocent and that he was being framed. In 1979 Buettner-Janusch was indicted; in 1980 he was
        sentenced to five years in prison, three for drug-related charges and two for lying to
        federal investigators. He was released on parole in 1983.</p>
      <p>In 1987, Buettner-Janusch was charged with sending poisoned chocolate candy to Charles L.
        Brieant, Jr., the federal judge who presided over his 1979 case. Virginia Brieant, Judge
        Brieant's wife, ate some of the candy and became seriously ill. He also sent similar
        poisoned candy to Duke University professor J. Bolling Sullivan, whose wife Ashley and
        daughter Ann became ill after eating some of the chocolates. Buettner-Janusch pled guilty to
        mailing the poisoned candy and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.</p>
      <p>On July 2, 1992, John Buettner-Janusch died of pneumonia in a medical center for prisoners,
        at the age of 67.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The John Buettner-Janusch Papers consist of letters written by Buettner-Janusch while in
        prison, primarily from 1987-1992, as well as clippings on his chargings and convictions.
        Several letters are addressed to "Annie and Will", although many letters are missing the
        first page or are not addressed, and many are undated. Most are handwritten. Many of the
        letters relate stories of Buettner-Janusch's research trips to Madagascar. Also included are
        clippings that detail accusations against him related to the manufacture of illegal drugs at
        NYU as well as the poisoned candy sent to Judge Brieant in 1987, and his obituary from the
        New York Times in 1992.</p>
