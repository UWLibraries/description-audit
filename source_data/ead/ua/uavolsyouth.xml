      <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
      <p>Volunteers for Youth, a national organization among colleges and universities, was started
        in 1969 at Stanford University. The Stanford Youth Program matched student athletes with
        junior high school-aged youth in the area. Youth received companionship and guidance from
        student athletes; students reported reaping personal rewards as well. In 1975, due to the
        overall success, former Stanford participants expanded the program to colleges and
        universities across the United States. Chapters were independently governed, and by 1977,
        some had failed because there was no national leadership. The National Collegiate Athletic
        Association agreed to sponsor Volunteers for Youth and funded four directors and staff
        members to serve chapters. The NCAA continued sponsorship through the mid-1980s. Individual
        colleges and universities sponsored programs from then on.</p>
      <p>The Duke University program was established around 1979. Student athletes were paired with
        local middle school students, serving as role models for local children by taking them on
        outings and helping them in school. Some of the activities coordinated by the Duke
        University Volunteers for Youth were basketball clinics, picnics, film festivals, football
        games, and concerts. Volunteers for Youth was governed by 8-10 student directors, several
        advisors from Duke University and the city of Durham, and middle school counselors. When the
        NCAA discontinued sponsorship in the mid-1980s, the Duke University chapter offered
        volunteer opportunities to non-athletes.</p>
      <p>As of 2003, Volunteers for Youth is affiliated with the Duke University Community Service
        Center, and provides volunteer opportunities for employees and students. </p>
