      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Office of Career Development and Continuing Education, active at Duke University from
        about 1969 to 1975, provided undergraduate and continuing education students with assistance
        in establishing career goals. In cooperation with the University Counseling Center, the
        Office of Placement Services, and deans in the undergraduate colleges and professional
        schools, the Office sponsored the Apprenticeship Program and the Continuing Education
        Program. The Apprenticeship Program arranged volunteer placement in community businesses and
        agencies. The Continuing Education Program placed students in local schools to work as
        teachers, tutors, and assistants. Other internship projects included helping local Girl
        Scouts groups, working in hospitals, counseling older adults, and acting as mentors to
        at-risk youth. Although the Office of Career Development and Continuing Education worked
        with both men and women, the Office was especially collaborative with student groups
        interested in women's programs and studies.</p>
      <p>Office of Career Development and Continuing Education also worked with other campus
        organizations to bring professionals to speak on campus about the issues of young women in a
        professional work environment, particularly Directions for Educated Women Committee, a
        student and faculty group at Trinity College. Directions for Educated Women Committee came
        together in 1966 when students from Trinity College expressed concerns for women's career
        orientation programs, especially the fact that there was an absence of centralized
        information for women to learn about careers. In response, the Committee was formed and
        promptly arranged a series of speakers. Various women professionals addressed preparation
        for graduate work, admission requirements for graduate schools, combining marriage and a
        career, and suggested opportunities for young women in their field. </p>
      <p>Around 1975, the name of the Office of Career Development and Continuing Education changed
        to the Office of Continuing Education. The Office continued to perform many of the same
        services for students, but with less focus on young women professionals. With the
        development of the Women's Studies Program at Duke University (1983) and the Women's Center
        (1989), career resources for women continue to be available.</p>
