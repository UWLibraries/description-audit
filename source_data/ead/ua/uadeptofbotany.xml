      <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>With the founding of Duke University in the 1920s, the Biology Department was created
        around a pair of Trinity College professors, Bert Cunningham, a zoologist, and Hugo
        Blomquist, a botanist. In 1927 they were joined by Arthur Pearse, a prominent ecologist and
        former president of the Ecological Society of America. Pearse added to the prestige of the
        department with his founding of Ecological Monographs, the first scientific journal
        published by Duke University Press. As the department moved to the Biology Building on the
        newly constructed West Campus, tensions between the botanists and zoologists led to a
        departmental rift. Eventually this rift led to the dissolution of the department in 1935 and
        the creation of the Botany Department, led by Blomquist, and the Zoology Department, led by
        Pearse. </p>
      <p>The growth in the new departments was complemented by the addition of new facilities. These
        included the first greenhouses in 1930, the Herbarium in 1931, the Sarah P. Duke Gardens in
        1934, and the Phytotron—one of the nation's first—in 1968. </p>
      <p>After World War II, the departments gained strong reputations in the fields of ecology,
        physiology, and systematics. During the 1970s and 1980s, greater research emphasis was
        placed on botany and zoology at the cellular and molecular level. Emphasis was also placed
        on interdisciplinary research across the Duke campus with faculty members participating in
        interdepartmental graduate programs. The first one, the University Program in Genetics, was
        founded in 1967 and was followed by the University Program in Ecology, the Developmental
        Biology Program, the Cell and Molecular Biology Program, and the Bioinformatics and Genome
        Technology Program. </p>
      <p>Eventually the separate Departments of Botany and Zoology began to drift back together. The
        two departments began co-teaching introductory biology in 1966 and offered a biology major
        in 1978. In 2000 the two departments dissolved and re-formed as the Department of
        Biology.</p>
