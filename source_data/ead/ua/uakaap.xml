      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>From: http://www.duke.edu/web/KappaAlpha/</p>
      <p>In the early 1860s, James Ward Wood of West Virginia had the first ideas for the fraternal
        organization that came to be known as Kappa Alpha Order. His family was sympathetic to the
        Confederate cause and in he joined a local cavalry regiment to fight with the Confederacy in
        the Civil War. In 1861, at age 15, he accidentally discharged a pistol, severely wounding
        his foot. While recuperating, he spent time reading about freemasonry, one of the oldest
        fraternal organizations in the world. </p>
      <p>In fall 1861, Wood carried his interests of fraternal brotherhood to Washington College in
        Lexington, Virginia. Once enrolled, he investigated the fraternities that existed on campus
        at the time. Not pleased, he simply decided that he would form his own secret organization
        and wrote a small set of rituals borrowed from other fraternities. On December 21, 1865, he
        met with others and bound their friendship by a mutual pledge of faith and loyalty, forming
        Phi Kappa Chi fraternity. The other fraternities looked scornfully upon the appearance of a
        new secret society on campus, and members of Phi Kappa Psi were especially perturbed at
        Wood's use of the name Phi Kappa Chi, because it was so similar to their own. Consequently,
        Wood was asked by a Phi Kappa Psi member to change the name, to which he obliged. The
        organization reemerged as the K.A. fraternity. At that time, the letters did not stand for
        Kappa Alpha. It is believed that Wood used the letters "K.A." (of the then popular
        fraternity Kuklos Adelphon) to attract members and attention. By the end of the spring 1866,
        the four founders had initiated seven additional members. </p>
      <p>One new initiate was Samuel Zenas Ammen, a Master Mason. As a member if Kappa Alpha, he
        developed a new ritual, constitution, bylaws, grip and symbols for the fraternity. His
        commitment ultimately earned him the title of Practical Founder of Kappa Alpha Order. The
        new ritual transformed the K.A. fraternity into Kappa Alpha Order, an order of Christian
        knights pledged to the highest ideals of character and achievement. Thus, they emulated
        their college's president, Robert E. Lee. </p>
      <p> Kappa Alpha began the 1867-1868 school year with Ammen as the new leader. During the year,
        the order began to look toward neighboring schools to establish more chapters in the south.
        By the close of 1870, five years after Kappa Alpha's founding, the Order's ranks had grown
        to eight chapters.</p>
      <p>The Alpha Phi chapter at Duke University was founded in 1901. The group was active on
        campus until dissolution in 1970. With the support of the Interfraternity Council, the Kappa
        Alpha Order national office, and many alumni, the chapter was reactivated in October 1978
        with 26 men. In 1983, Alpha Phi chapter moved to Brown House on East Campus. Alpha Phi's low
        damages, strong campus involvement, and absence of noise violations helped them earn 50%
        more space in Brown House for the 1984-1985 year. Since their reactivation, they have
        competed in intramural sports, raised funds for various community groups, and raised funds
        for Duke University. The Alpha Phi chapter is currently (2008) active on the Duke campus.
        They are governed by the Interfraternity Council. </p>
