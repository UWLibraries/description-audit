         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Dred Peacock was born in Wilson County, North Carolina in 1864 to C. C. Peacock, MD and
            Eva Heath Peacock. He received the following degrees from Trinity College (Randolph
            County, N.C.): A. B. (1887), A. M. (1888), Litt. D. (1899). On June 9, 1887, the day of
            his graduation, he married Ella Carr (born in 1865), daughter of Trinity College
            professor O. W. Carr. She graduated from Greensboro Female College when she was 18 years
            old, and her father was a member of its Board of Directors. Dred became a professor at
            Greensboro Female College in 1888, teaching Latin and German, as well as physics and
            chemistry. In 1894, he became its President. He served in that role until 1902, when he
            resigned for health reasons. He continued his relationship with the college by serving
            its Board with his father-in-law. </p>
         <p>During his tenure as President, the Peacock's daughter, Ethel Carr Peacock, died at the
            age of 6. In her memory, the Peacocks endowed the library at Greensboro Female College,
            eventually accumulating over 7,000 volumes. When it appeared the College would close due
            to financial problems, and in accordance with a resolution passed by the College's
            Board, the Peacocks gifted their library to Trinity College (now in Durham County, N.C.)
            as the Ethel Carr Peacock Memorial Collection.</p>
         <p>Dred Peacock died at Duke Hospital in 1934. Ella Carr Peacock died in 1947. Both are
            interred in the Trinity Cemetery (Trinity, N.C.).</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>This collection contains 7 scrapbooks and one notebook listing articles. It is unclear
            as to which Peacock created them, as both Dred and Ella had strong ties to the main
            subjects: Greensboro Female College and Trinity College (now Duke University). The
            scrapbooks include the Ethel Carr Peacock Memorial bookplate and consists largely of
            clippings and event programs as they pertain to both colleges. There are also clippings
            related to topics such as the American Civil War and local news and dignitaries. These
            volumes are fragile and should be handled with care. The notebook contains a list of
            newspaper and magazine articles on North Carolina history compiled by Dred Peacock and
            at least one other individual, possibly Charles Lee Raper.</p>
