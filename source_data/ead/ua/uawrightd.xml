      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Dean Scanlan Wright was born in Brownsville, Texas on February 14, 1941, and grew up in
        Coral Gables, Florida. He attended Duke University and earned a psychology degree in 1962.
        While at Duke, Wright played football for the Blue Devils from 1958 to 1961, as halfback.
        During this time, the Duke football team earned two consecutive ACC Championships (1960 and
        1961) and won the Cotton Bowl (1961). Dean Wright received many honors as an outstanding
        player, including the Team MVP Award and invitations to play in the honorary North-South
        Game (1961) and in the All-America Game (1962).</p>
      <p> After college, Wright was drafted into the National Football League to play for the
        Houston Oilers, but he injured his knee after one season and returned to Florida. Wright
        then became a pilot, flying for a number of airlines during his career. Dean Wright died on
        March 31, 2002 in Coral Gables, Florida. He was survived by his wife, Vivian Wright. </p>
