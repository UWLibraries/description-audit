      <p>The President's Committee to Address Discrimination in the Classroom (PCADC) was created in
        April 1988. Then-President H. Keith Brodie convened the committee as a response to
        allegations of discriminations against students made at a forum sponsored by the Duke
        University Black Alumni Connection, and he directed the group to both "determine the extent
        of discrimination experienced by our students through their interactions with faculty as
        well as with other students in the classroom" and, if discrimination was found, to "develop
        a series of recommendations" on "how this University should address this problem."</p>
      <p>The Committee was headed by Professor Grant Shockley and included faculty, students, and
        administrators. The group conducted an extensive survey of students to assess perceptions of
        discrimination among students of different racial backgrounds. The survey found that black
        students were much less likely to view race relations at Duke as good than white students,
        and revealed a gap between perceptions of discriminatory behavior for blacks and whites.
        Survey results were analyzed and presented in a report to President Brodie, along with
        recommendations to eliminate racial discrimination at Duke. Recommendations included
        establishing a complaint procedure for reporting racial discrimination, offering racial
        sensitivity training, and improving student services that address social, cultural, and
        academic problems, among other suggestions.</p>
      <p>In February 1989, the report and its recommendations were formally endorsed by the
        President's Council on Black Affairs.</p>
