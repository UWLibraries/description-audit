      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Charles L.B. Lowndes was a professor at Duke Law School who taught Richard M. Nixon as a
        student. In 1954 Nixon was invited to give the commencement address at Duke University, but
        the faculty voted against granting him an honorary degree, igniting a controversy on campus,
        and Nixon eventually declined the invitation to deliver the commencement address.</p>
      <p>Charles L.B. Lowndes was born in 1904 and received his LL.B. from Harvard Law School in
        1926 and his S.J.D. in 1930, also from Harvard. He joined the faculty of Duke Law School in
        1934, teaching, researching, and writing on tax law. He served as Acting Dean of the Law
        School for the 1949-1950 academic year, and was granted Duke Law's first named distinguished
        professorship, the James B. Duke Professorship, in 1955. He died July 28, 1967.</p>
      <p>Richard Milhous Nixon (1913-1994) attended the Duke University School of Law from 1934 to
        1937, graduating number three in a class of twenty-six. During his three years at Duke,
        Nixon was active in the Duke Bar Association and was elected President in his senior year.
        He then served in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate before being
        selected as Dwight D. Eisenhower's running mate in the 1952 U.S. Presidential election.
        Eisenhower won, and Richard Nixon became the Vice President of the United States in January,
        1953.</p>
      <p>In 1954 then-President of Duke University A. Hollis Edens invited then-Vice President Nixon
        to deliver the commencement address that year. Traditionally, the commencement speaker is
        given an honorary degree by the University. However, the faculty of the university voted
        against granting Nixon an honorary degree, and the resulting controversy prompted Charles
        Lowndes, Nixon's former Duke Law Professor, to write to Nixon, advising against giving the
        commencement address. Richard Nixon never gave a commencement address at Duke
        University.</p>
