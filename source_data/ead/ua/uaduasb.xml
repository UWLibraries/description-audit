            label="General Physical Description note"><extent>Scrapbook 24 belonged to Grace Long of
              Mebane, NC. Included in the scrapbook are a 1919 Cornelian Initiation Banquet program,
              a 1919 Trinity College commencement invitation, a recital program from Enochville
              School, a Trinity Lutheran Church bulletin, postage stamps, telegrams, name-cards,
              Valentines, clippings and other epherma. Grace Long had a connection to the North
              Carolina College for Women as some of the contents related to it. The black and white
              photographs are largely of identified and unidentified people and buildings, including
              Trinity College buildings and buildings at the University of North Carolina. Most of
              the people are posed for the camera, some or around their cars. There is a picture of
              a plane from this time period as well. There are a couple of pictures of men in what
              are likely World War I military uniforms. There is one picture of the Durham
              Reservoir. Some of the images have become detached from the scrapbook. Note that there
              is handwriting on some of these pictures. These images have been placed in protective
              sleeves. Towards the end of the scrapbook is a postcard of the Leo Frank lynching
              (Georgia, 1915). </extent></physdesc>
