         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Originally from Wilson Mills, NC, Clara Odessa Massey attended Smithfield High School in
            Smithfield, NC, where she was active in theater. She graduated in the spring of 1924 and
            enrolled at Duke that fall. She was a member of the Y.W.C.A. and the Athena Literary
            Society, and had an active social and dating life. She received multiple reprimands,
            including from the Women's Student Government Association for failure to meet with
            dating protocol. She remained at Duke until 1928, although she did not graduate.</p>
