      <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
      <p>Gilbert Theodore Rowe was born in Salisbury, NC on September 10, 1875. His father was
        Joseph Columbus Rowe, a Methodist minister. He received his A.B. and D.D. from Trinity
        College in 1895 and 1914, respectively. He earned his S.T.D. at Temple University in 1905
        and was awarded a Litt.D. from Duke University in 1925. He was admitted to the Western North
        Carolina Conference in 1896, only six years after the two state conferences were formed.
        Received into Full Connection in 1898, he began to serve pastorates, in eleven successive
        appointments, until 1920. It was while he served the church at Albemarle that he married
        Caroline Pearle Bostian in 1902. They had two sons.</p>
      <p> In 1920, Dr. Rowe became editor, first of the North Carolina Christian Advocate and then
        of the Methodist Quarterly Review at Nashville until 1928, serving simultaneously as Book
        Editor for the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. It was in this period that he produced his
        works, The Meaning of Methodism and Reality in Religion for the 1927 Quillian Lectures at
        Emory University. </p>
      <p> In 1928, Dr. Rowe accepted an offer from Duke President William Few to return to his alma
        mater as Professor and Chair of Christian Doctrine in the School of Religion at Duke
        University. He served as Professor of Christine Doctrine at the University until his
        retirement in 1949, and continued to serve both Duke and the Methodist church until his
        death on February 10, 1960. </p>

      <head>Scope and Contents note</head>

        includes some material concerning Dr. Rowe's father, Joseph Columbus Rowe (1848-1920). The
