         <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
         <p>Margaret Durham was born on April 14, 1898 in Gastonia, NC. She attended Martha
            Washington College in Abingdon, VA from 1913-1916, and then transferred to Trinity
            College for her senior year, graduating in 1917. One of several family members to attend
            Trinity, she was a member of Kappa Delta and Delta Phi Rho Alpha and served as secretary
            of the Virginia Club.</p>
         <p> In September 1922, she married Harry Russell Robey. She taught French and English
            Literature at Martha Washington College and Southern Seminary Junior College, and
            succeeded her father as President of the Southern Seminary. She received a Master's
            degree in Education from the University of Virginia in 1952, and served on multiple
            academic and non-academic committees on educational, social and women's issues. Durham
            was also President of the Alumni Association. </p>

         <p>Contains photographs, correspondence (including letters of courtship), mementos
            (ribbons, invitations, flowers) from parties and events, film and concert programs,
            ticket stubs, cigarettes, food wrappers and clippings. Also contains ephemera from
            visits to Dope Shop, including straws and wrappers. Most items are accompanied by

         <head>Collection Arrangement</head>
         <p>These items were originally included in a string-bound scrapbook created by Margaret
            Durham. The scrapbook was 50 pages long and contained items reflecting her
            extra-curricular life at Trinity from 1916-1917. Items from 1917-1918 include
            photographs of a May Day celebration, as well as clippings regarding and correspondence
            with classmates from Trinity, many of whom served in the U.S. military during World War
            I. The original scrapbook contained many three-dimensional objects, which had separated
            from the bookâ€™s pages. Pages were removed and placed in archival folders, and loose
            items in envelopes, for preservation.</p>
