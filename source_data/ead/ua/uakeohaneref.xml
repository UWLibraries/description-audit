         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Nannerl O. Keohane served as Duke University's eighth president, from 1993 to 2004. She
            was born in Blytheville, Ark., and grew up in Arkansas, Texas, and South Carolina. Her
            parents, who were great music lovers, named her after Mozart's musically talented
            sister, Nannerl. Her father, James Overholser, a Presbyterian minister, went on to earn
            a doctorate in theology and taught religion and theology at St. Andrews Presbyterian
            College in Laurinburg, North Carolina. Her mother, Grace Overholser White, worked as a
            reporter before marriage and then, later in life, taught English and served as dean at
            St. Andrews. </p>
         <p>Nan Keohane was valedictorian of her Hot Springs (Ark.) High School. She is a 1961
            graduate of Wellesley College, where she graduated Phi Beta Kappa with honors in
            political science. Following graduation from Wellesley, she was awarded a Marshall
            Scholarship to Oxford University, where she earned the B.A.-M.A. with First Class Honors
            in philosophy, politics, and economics. She received her Ph.D. in political science in
            1967 from Yale, where she was a Sterling Fellow and, later, was awarded the Wilbur Cross
            Medal in recognition of her distinguished service as an alumna. </p>
         <p>Before assuming the presidency of Wellesley in 1981, she taught at Swarthmore College,
            the University of Pennsylvania, and Stanford University, where she was chair of the
            faculty senate and won the Gores Award for Excellence in Teaching. </p>
         <p>Keohane has written extensively in the fields of political philosophy, feminism and
            education. She is the author of <title type="simple" render="italic">Philosophy and the
               State in France: The Renaissance to the Enlightenment</title> (Princeton University
            Press, 1980) and co-editor of <title type="simple" render="italic">Feminist Theory: A
               Critique of Ideology</title> (University of Chicago Press, 1982). She was vice
            president of the American Political Science Association from 1988 to 1990. </p>
         <p>Keohane has served on the boards of IBM, the National Humanities Center, the Doris Duke
            Charitable Foundation and the Research Triangle Foundation of North Carolina. She is a
            Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical
            Society, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and chairs the Overseers Committee
            to Visit the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. </p>
         <p>She has been awarded honorary doctoral degrees by numerous colleges and universities.
            She was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in October 1995, and won the
            Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1998.</p>
