        student organization dedicated to making Duke more inclusive and accessible. The Duke
        Disability Alliance Records include materials from a 2017 exhibit for Disability Pride Week

      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>The Duke Disability Alliance (DDA) was founded in 2010 by students including Megan Barron.
        The organization's mission is "to make Duke more inclusive and accessible by fostering
        conversations about disability issues, expanding accessibility on campus and in the
        community, encouraging positive perceptions and full appreciations of people with
        disabilities, and promoting their legal rights." They "strive to engage the entire Duke
        community to make Duke a better place for those with and without disabilities." DDA has
        organized campaigns to raise awareness of disability-related issues, including the
        Accessibility Matters campaign and the Goin' My Way campaign, and has worked with the Duke
        Student Government and the Student Disability Access Office to increase accessibility and
        awareness across campus.</p>
      <p>In 2017 the DDA partnered with Dr. Marion Quirici's Writing 101 course "Modernism and
        Madness," in which students in the class created projects included in an exhibition for
        Disability Pride Week, displayed in Perkins Library during April 2017. The projects from Dr.
        Quirici's class were on the theme of NeuroDIVERSITY and Inclusion, with the aim "to overturn
        the stigma of mental disability and psychiatric challenges, to celebrate neurodiversity, and
        to explore the infrastructures of inclusion and exclusion in modern American life."</p>
