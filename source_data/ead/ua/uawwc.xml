      <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
      <p>Wilbur Wade Card was born on October 29, 1873 in Franklinton, North Carolina to Sabert
        Henry Card and Cecilia Bennett Fuller. He entered Trinity College in 1895 and became one of
        the school's best athletes. He set and broke numerous baseball records as an outfielder and
        hitter and served as captain of the Trinity baseball team in 1899 (for which he received his
        nickname, "Cap"). </p>
      <p>After graduating in 1900, he attended the Harvard School of Physical Education and
        graduated after a year long program. He returned to Harvard every summer through 1913 to
        train and work at the famed Sargent Normal School of Physical Education. While at his first
        job as director of the Mobile, Alabama YMCA, Card was invited by President John C. Kilgo to
        return to Trinity as Director of a new program in physical education. He remained at Trinity
        College/Duke University for the next 46 years. </p>
      <p>From 1902-1912, Card worked as both Director and coach of various sports such as baseball.
        After the 1912 season, he stepped aside as coach to devote all of his time to being
        Director. One of the many highlights of Card's career is his introduction of the game of
        basketball to the State of North Carolina. He coached Trinity College for the first game,
        played with Wake Forest College in 1906. For this, he is considered the "Father of
        Intercollegiate Basketball in North Carolina."</p>
      <p>Wilbur Wade Card died September 3, 1948 of a heart attack. He was interred at Maplewood
        Cemetery in Durham. In March 1958, the Duke Gymnasium was renamed the Wilbur Wade Card
        Gymnasium in his honor.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
      <p>The collection includes volumes of physical education and examination records of male
        students from Trinity College and Trinity Park School, correspondence, photographs, a
        scrapbook, articles, clippings and miscellaneous printed matter. </p>
      <p>The physical education records include students' names and grades from Card's physical
        education classes. The physical examination volumes include information about each student,
        including his name, birthplace, father's occupation, which parent the student resembled, and
        general comments made by Card. Corresponding with this information is the date of the
        examination, the student's age, weight, height, the girth, depth and breadth of several body
        parts (such as knees, thighs, shoulders, etc.), the color of hair and eyes, temperament, and
        other facts.</p>
      <p>The correspondence includes letters written to Card by former baseball and football
        players, including Arthur Bradsher, as well as copies of letters Card wrote. The
        athletics-related items include batting scores, etc. compiled by Card as well as writings he
        did, such as "Ben F. Few Makes the Greatest Outfield Catch" and "Three Greatest Plays Made
        by Trinity Men." He also wrote about Robert M. Gantt, a.k.a. "Big Bob."</p>
      <p>The miscellany folders include a 1907-1908 map of Cambridge, MA (in the vicinity of Harvard
        College), event cards for the Trinity College Athletic Association's first field and track
        meet, a list of the strongest students in college in 1900 as well as other items related to
        the physical examination of Trinity students and athletic events, including a program for
        the first annual North Carolina Olympic Games in 1922. Also included are items related to
        Card's time at Harvard (including his own physical examination), the Raleigh Male Academy,
        the Franklinton Classical and Military Institute, Trinity College and Duke University, as
        well as clippings and some correspondence. </p>
      <p>The State was a weekly survey of North Carolina, presented in magazine form. The issues in
        Card's collection include articles he wrote about athletics, including "Football Stars of
        By-gone Days," "No Hits and No Runs," and "Trinity vs. Carolina in 1898." </p>
      <p>The scrapbook largely contains clippings and programs that relate to athletics at both
        Trinity College and Harvard and also includes the 1900 Trinity College commencement program
        as well as a program from the [President] McKinley Memorial Services (Mobile Theatre),
        September 1901. The pages are very fragile and the scrapbook should be handled with
        care.</p>
      <p>The photographs include one oversized card-mounted photograph that is in need of repair as
        it is split into two pieces. The image is of the cast (of which Card's wife was a member) of
        an 1892 cantata called "Dream of Fairy Land." The program for the cantata can be found in
        the miscellany folder. The other photographs are largely card-mounted and include images of
        Card, his relatives, and athletic teams. Most are identified and some are dated.</p>
      <p>The collection ranges in date from 1876-1943.</p>
