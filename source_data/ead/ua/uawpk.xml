      <head>Collection Arrangement</head>
      <p>Kellam originally included these items in a 36-page, string-bound patent scrapbook
        published by the College Memorabilia Company, with the Trinity College seal on the cover.
        Because the string of the binding had broken, the scrapbook pages were placed in folders,
        for preservation.</p>
