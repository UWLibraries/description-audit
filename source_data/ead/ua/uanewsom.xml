               Biography</title>, ed. by William S. Powell Volume 4, L-O, 1991, pp. 366-367.</p>
         <p>D.W. (Dallas Walton) Newsom was an educational administrator, county manager, scholar,
            and poet. He was born in Littleton, North Carolina to Marion Eaton and Annie Soule
            Heptinstall Newsom in 1873. Newsom entered Trinity College (now Duke University) in the
            fall of 1895 beginning a twenty-seven year association with the institution. </p>
         <p>During his student days at Trinity, Newsom was a member of various scholastic and social
            clubs including Phi Beta Kappa, the 9019, Sigma Upsilon, and the Alpha Phi chapter of
            Kappa Alpha. He was also a campus leader serving as senior class president, editor of
            The Trinity Archive, as well as holding various officer positions in the Hesperian
            Literary Society. His involvement in the Hesperian Literary Society culminated in his
            winning its orator's medal in 1898. At the end of his first year, Newsom became the
            private secretary to President John C. Kilgo prompting a life-long friendship between
            the two men. </p>
         <p>When Newsom graduated from Trinity in 1899 he received a post in Havana, Cuba, on
            recommendation from President Kilgo, where he served as a private secretary to the
            comptroller of customs in the U.S. Customs House. In 1901, Newsom returned to Trinity
            becoming the college registrar and six years later college treasurer a post he held
            until 1923. During this time, Newsom was also the recording secretary to the Board of
            Trustees and a member of the officers' finance committee. </p>
         <p>In 1923, Newsom left academic administration to enter private enterprise opening a real
            estate and insurance sales and service office in Durham. He was active in private
            business for seven years. Concurrently, he also served as secretary-treasurer and then
            president (1928) of the Durham Real Estate Board and as director of the State Board of
            Realtors. </p>
         <p>Newsom also held several public offices. In 1924 he was appointed to the Durham County
            Board of Commissioners. He served for four terms. Governor Angus W. McLean named him to
            the Governor's Commission for a Survey and Study of County Government designed to
            "project the modernization of county governments" in 1925. This appointment led to
            Newsom's appointment to the Governor's County Government Advisory Commission
            (1927-1931). In 1930 Newsom became Durham County's first county manager, and one of the
            few county managers in the nation.</p>
         <p>Newsom's published works include two books of poetry: <title type="simple"
               render="italic">Song and Dream </title>(1922) and A<title type="simple"
               render="italic">long the Silent Ways </title>(1973). The later was published
            posthumously by his daughters in celebration of the one hundredth anniversary of his
            birth. He also penned a <title type="simple" render="italic">History of Duke Memorial
               Methodist Church</title> from 1886 to 1932 (1933) and <title type="simple"
               render="italic">Chapel Talks</title> (1922) by President John Carlisle Kilgo,
            transcribed from notes taken by Newsom. Newsom passed away in 1949. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Newsom collection primarily contains material collected or created by D.W. Newsom
            concerning Trinity College president John C. Kilgo. Materials present include
            correspondence between Newsom and Kilgo, clippings of Kilgo's speeches, articles,
            visitations, and obituary from various local and regional newspapers, and some
            biographical writings regarding Kilgo. Major subjects include: Trinity College (Durham
            County, NC); Christian education; and the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.</p>
         <p>Also present in the collection are some materials relating to Newsom's administrative
            duties at Trinity College including a repair book (1911-1918), some memoranda concerning
            Trinity College, and miscellaneous letters. Of particular note are the responses to a
            janitorial service survey sent by Newsom to Trinity's peer institutions in 1920 asking
            for operational details of various institutions' housekeeping staff. Questions on the
            survey address race of staff, number of hours worked, salary, paid vacation/sick-leave,
            bonuses, division of responsibilities, retention, and age of workers. </p>
         <p>Newsom kept various notebooks for jotting down thoughts, poetic words, and subjects of
            interest such as physics or Kilgo, philosophic quotations, and writings. These notebooks
            are present in the collection. Many of Newsom's notes are in shorthand. </p>
