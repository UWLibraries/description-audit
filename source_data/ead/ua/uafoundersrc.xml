      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>One of the long-standing traditions of Trinity College and Duke University is the
        observance of honoring the benefactors of the institution. The practice was formalized by
        the Board of Trustees on June 4, 1901, when October 3 was designated as Benefactors' Day in
        honor of Washington Duke.</p>
      <p>The original intent "to honor Washington Duke forever" has been kept in spirit but through
        the years the name and even date of the annual observance has changed. It has been called
        Benefactors' Day (1901-1924), Duke University Day (1926-1947), and since 1948, Founders'
        Day. The most common forms of recognition have been an address on campus, the laying of a
        wreath at the tombs of the Dukes, and for many years the planting of trees by the senior
        class presidents to beautify the campus. The day has been the occasion for the presentation
        of special donations and awards, the dedication of buildings or gifts such as the Flentrop
        Organ in 1976, and the awarding of honorary degrees.</p>
      <p>After the creation of Duke University, the date shifted to December 11 in honor of the
        signing of the Indenture of The Duke Endowment. The new Duke University Day was largely a
        product of the Office of Alumni Affairs. Local alumni chapters were encouraged to meet on
        December 11 to elect officers and to hear what could be characterized as a "state of the
        university" report. These meetings grew from ten in North Carolina and Virginia in 1926 to a
        high of over sixty nationwide in 1936. In 1927 the first meeting was held in New York City,
        and in 1930 the first Alumni chapter was organized in Los Angeles. In 1931 there also were
        observances in China and Japan. These meetings were greatly curtailed from 1939 to 1945.</p>
      <p>After 1948 primary attention returned to campus where prominent speakers were featured
        along with significant announcements to the University community. In 1967 the annual event
        was shifted to the Sunday nearest December 11 with the primary focus on the morning worship
        service in the Chapel. In 1986 that observance was extended to a long weekend beginning with
        a formal campus-wide Convocation on Thursday immediately following an annual meeting of the
        faculty. </p>
      <p>With the 1997 celebration, the ceremonies were again moved, back to a date in the early
        Fall. The events of the weekend include a memorial for members of the community deceased
        during the year passed, recognition of outstanding students, faculty, and staff, and the
        presentations of awards for teaching, the Distinguished Alumni Award, and the University
        Medal for Distinguished Meritorious Service at Duke. </p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>This collection was compiled from a variety of sources by the University Archives for use
        in reference and research. It includes the general history of Founders' Day, lists of
        speakers (1926-2006), recipient lists for various honoraries including: the University Medal
        for Distinguished Meritorious Service at Duke; Distinguished Alumni Award; distinguished
        Teaching Awards; University Teacher/Scholar Award; Trinity College Distinguished Teaching
        Award; Howard Johnson Distinguished Teaching Award; and Humanitarian Service Award. The
        collection also has speeches/remarks/sermons/ programs for the Founders' Day celebrations
        throughout the years (1901; 1916; 1930-2006), as well, as a scrapbook of the 1956 Founders'
        Day celebration that commemorated the 100th anniversary of James Buchanan Duke's birth.</p>
