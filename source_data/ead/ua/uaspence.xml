         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Born in South Mills, North Carolina (June 12, 1882) and educated at Trinity College,
            Durham (A.B., 1907; A.M. 1908) and Duke University (B.D., 1927) Hersey Everett Spence
            was a minister, educator, and writer. After graduating from Trinity in 1908 he spent ten
            years in the pastorate before returning to his alma mater in 1918 as Professor of
            Religious Education and Biblical Literature. (This is believed to be the first
            appointment of a Professor of Religious Education in a southern college.)</p>
         <p>Spence was active in Methodist education throughout North Carolina, and well known
            through his service on the North Carolina Pastors' School, the Sunday School Board, and
            the Methodist Board of Education, as well as, for his pastorates held in Raleigh,
            Durham, Sanford, and Blowing Rock. He taught the Heresy Spence Sunday School Class at
            Duke Memorial Methodist Church for forty years. At his retirement in 1952 it was
            believed that Dr. Spence had taught about two-thirds of the Methodist ministers then
            serving in North Carolina. </p>
         <p>Spence was also known as a public speaker and author of poetry and religious drama. For
            twenty years he wrote and directed the Christmas Pageant a main feature of the Duke
            University Christmas exercises. His Choral Communion Service-the Rhapsody of
            Redemption-was also a fixture of the pre-Easter season at Duke and often played to
            overflow capacity in the University Chapel. Over the years he produced many pageants and
            poem for religious, educational, and civic occasions as well as radio broadcasts. A
            number of his programs were used throughout the Southeast and in the Methodist Church at
            large. A listing of his formal publications include: "Reveries in Rhyme," "A Guide to
            Bible Study," "Ruth," "Marching Men of Methodism," "When Cross Roads Cross Again," "Old
            Testament Dramas," "The Bishop's Crusade," "Pageants," and "Holidays and Holy Days." </p>
         <p>On October 8, 1913, Spence married Bessie Octavia Whitted of Durham. Mrs. Spence an
            alumna of Trinity College, Duke University (A.B, A.M.), and the University of Chicago
            (B.D.) taught for a number of years in the local Durham city schools, and in 1928-1929
            was the Dean of Girls at Durham High School. In 1929-1930 she became an assistant
            professor of Biblical Literature in the Department of Religion at Duke University. The
            Spence's retired from Duke University in 1952 after a combined 60 years of service.</p>
         <p>Upon his retirement Professor Spence was honored with the distinction of being the first
            recipient at Duke University of the Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award. He was also granted
            honorary degrees from Asbury Theological Seminary (Doctor of Divinity) and High Point
            College (Doctor of Letters). </p>
         <p>Hersey Everett Spence died September 30, 1973. Mrs. Spence followed soon after passing
            away on October 7, 1973. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Hersey Everett Spence papers contain correspondence, writings (poems, plays,
            eulogies by Smith), clippings, a sound recording, and other printed material reflecting
            the opinions and career of H.E. Spence. Spence was noted for his outspokenness on the
            state of the University and on matters such as desegregation (he was not in favor) and
            athletics (he was in favor). Other subjects present include: biography and family
            genealogy; the Methodist Retirement Home; and the Duke Memorial Methodist Church (both
            in Durham, NC). The collection includes over 100 unpublished poems; a copy of Spence's
            "When Preacher's Meet", a volume concerning the NC Pastor's School; the typescript of "I
            Remember" (1954) [400 pages, titled "Fifty Years of Alma Mater"]; and a taped interview
            (12 June 1970; no transcript). The materials in the collection range in date from 1794;
            1904-1973; with the bulk of the materials dating from 1938 to 1970.</p>
