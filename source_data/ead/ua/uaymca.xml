        (YMCA) at Duke University was established at then Trinity College in 1887-1888. In its early
        years, it functioned primarily as a sort of Bible class. Although it never abandoned its

        of the material is from the late 1930s to the early 1960s and consists mainly of annual
        reports. The majority of the remaining material consists of reports from other student
        religious organizations. Physical types of materials present include reports, pamphlets,
        correspondence, minutes, student publications, programs, flyers, and officer lists. There is
        one artifact, a gavel that is engraved with presidents' initials and years of service,
        1945-1955.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
      <p>The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) at Duke University was established at Trinity
        College in 1887-1888. In its early years, it functioned primarily as a sort of Bible class.
        Although it never abandoned its emphasis on Christianity, in its later years the YMCA
        dedicated itself more to campus and social service projects than Bible study. It was one of
        the largest and most influential of the student organizations. Activities for the years
        1947-1967 include the Edgemont Community Center, Wright's Refuge, Freshman Orientation Week,
        publication of the student handbook, Religious Emphasis Week, Dads' Day, discussion groups,
        vespers services, Bible study, and student ushers for Duke Chapel. A Board of Directors
        composed of faculty and administration members oversaw the YMCA. </p>
      <p>In 1969, the YMCA merged with the Young Women's Christian Association to form the YM-YWCA.
        Post-merger activities include draft counseling, Vietnam seminars and discussions,
        sponsorship of speakers and activists, promotion of Black Days, and so on. The organization
        ceased functioning in 1980-1981. See also issues of the <title type="simple" render="italic"
          >Chanticleer</title>, the <title type="simple" render="italic">Chronicle</title>, and
        student handbooks as well as <title type="simple" render="italic">The Front Line: Materials
          for a Study of Leadership in College and After</title> by Ben M. Patrick (Duke University,
        1938) for more historical details. See YM-YWCA Institute for Nonviolent Study and Action and
        YWCA materials for more detail on collaborative activities in the 1960s-1970s. </p>

      <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
      <p>These records were produced by the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) at Duke
        University in the course of their activities as a student religious organization. Materials
        are present from 1920 to 1969; however, the bulk of the material is from the late 1930s to
        the early 1960s and consists mainly of annual reports. The majority of the remaining
        material consists of reports from other student religious organizations. Physical types of
        materials present include reports, pamphlets, correspondence, minutes, student publications,
        programs, flyers, and officer lists. There is one artifact, a gavel that is engraved with
        presidents' initials and years of service, 1945-1955.</p>
      <p> The majority of the records consist of reports of campus student religious organizations,
        and annual reports prepared by YMCA officers, which date from 1936-1967, although they are
        not inclusive. The annual reports summarize YMCA activities and projects from the past
        school year, and offer suggestions for the next year. See also catalogued and bound reports
        at call number 378.756 D887FA. There are two reports generated by the YMCA in the course of
        their campus activities: a proposal regarding the Freshman Advisory Council and a report on
        the success of the 1948 fund drive for the World Student Service Fund (WSSF). For more
        information on the incorporation of the Freshman Advisory Council (FAC) into the YMCA, see
        the annual report from 1957-1958. The remaining reports were created by other student
        religious organizations such as the Hillel Society (for Jewish students), the Baptist
        Student Union, and the YWCA. Correspondence is limited to one item. "Dads' Day" items
        consist of programs and schedules for the annual fathers' weekend. See also programs at call
        number 378.756 D887FD. </p>
      <p>Publications are limited to examples of the student handbook and the "Dink," a daily
        publication for freshmen produced during Freshman Orientation Week. For other student
        handbooks see call number 378.756 D877S. For discussions of activities related to
        desegregation at Duke, see annual reports 1959-1960 and 1967-1968. Draft counseling
        materials are limited to announcements of seminars and conferences. For discussions of
        Vietnam and the selective service system, see annual reports of 1966-1967 and 1967-1968. For
        more information on Vietnam, the draft, and the counseling center, see YWCA and YM-YWCA
        Institute for Nonviolent Study and Action materials. Although there are no membership lists,
        there are quite inclusive lists of officers from 1888-1936 and 1956-1957. </p>
