      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Richard Halleck Brodhead became Duke's ninth president on July 1, 2004, after a 32-year
        career at Yale University. In addition to serving as president, he is a professor of English
        at Duke. Born in Dayton, Ohio, he graduated from Yale in 1968 and received his Ph.D. there
        in 1972. He then joined the Yale faculty, where he became the A. Bartlett Giamatti Professor
        of English and American Studies. After serving as chair of Yale's Department of English for
        six years, Brodhead was named dean of Yale College in 1993 and served in the post for 11
        years until he assumed Duke's presidency. His writings as dean are collected in The Good of
        This Place: Values and Challenges in College Education. He was presented with the 2006
        Wilbur Lucius Cross Medal by the Yale Graduate School Alumni Association.</p>
