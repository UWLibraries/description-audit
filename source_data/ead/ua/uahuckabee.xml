        administrative leadership positions during her more than 20 years at the Woman's College,
        including Assistant Dean, Associate Dean, and Dean of Undergraduate Instruction. This
        collection documents Huckabee's career and her strong interest in fostering education in
        women through travel. Her interest in understanding generational differences and their
        significance in effectively educating students is highlighted here. Her post-retirement
        civic participation is captured in her formal statement at a public meeting in 1979 against
        the proposed East-West Freeway in Durham. The collection ranges in date from
        1924-1979.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
      <p>After graduating from high school in Albemarle, N.C., Ellen Huckabee attended Duke
        University, where she received her A.B. (magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa) in 1928 and her
        A.M. in 1931. While an undergraduate, she was president of the Woman's Student Government
        Association and a member of Kappa Delta Phi, an honorary educational fraternity. Her first
        position after receiving her A.B. was Assistant to the Dean of the Woman's College of Duke
        University. After receiving her A.M., she took a position on the staff of the Dean of
        Students at the New Jersey College for Women (now Douglass College). She remained there from
        1931 to 1937, then returning to Duke in the capacity of Assistant Dean of Women and
        Counselor of Pegram House. After a year of travel in Central America beginning in 1941,
        followed by a short stint as Y.M.C.A director in Columbia, S.C., she was commissioned in the
        Naval Reserves, serving for 3 years before being discharged in 1945 with the rank of
        Lieutenant Commander. That same year she attended summer school at Cambridge and then
        returned to Duke University Woman's College in the position of Academic Advisor for freshmen
        and sophomores. In 1945 she became Assistant Dean of Undergraduate Instruction at the
        Woman's College, rising to Associate Dean in 1950 and to Dean in 1952. She held the latter
        position until her retirement in 1967, at which time she was also serving as the Acting Dean
        of the Woman's College. In that same year, she married Luther L. Gobbel. After her
        retirement, she traveled extensively with her husband, and in 1969 she moved with him to
        Alabama, where he served a short term as interim president of Athens College. They later
        retired to Durham. Ellen Huckabee died January 1995.</p>
