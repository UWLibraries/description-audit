         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Born Feb. 5, 1896, in Brockton, Mass., Nelson was educated at Clark University (A.B.,
            1916; A.M., 1921) and Cornell University (Ph.D, 1925). He was an assistant in Medieval
            History at Cornell (1922-1923), assistant professor at the University of South Dakota
            (1923-1925), professor of Medieval History at Cornell University (1926),and assistant
            curator of the President White Historical Library. In 1926, he came to Duke University
            and stayed until his retirement in 1965.</p>
         <p>Nelson received a number of awards and grants. He was named an Andrew D. White Fellow in
            European History (1921-1922) and studied at the Sorbonne, Ecole de Droit, Ecole des
            Hautes Etudes, and the University of Cologne. He also received an American Council of
            Learned Societies Grant (1930-1931) and spent the year in Italy. Nelson was a member of
            the Medieval Academy of America, the American Historical Association, and the Phi Kappa
            Phi scholarship society. </p>
         <p>Nelson's special interests in research and teaching were Renaissance civilization, the
            history of liberty and ideas of tolerance, heresy and persecution, church and state
            relations, italian origins of modern diplomacy, and balance-of-power relationships.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Ernest W. Nelson Records and Papers is divided into three series: Subject Files, the
            Chamber Arts Society, and Personal and Family Materials. The collection includes
            correspondence, financial records, lectures, reports, student papers, and other printed
            material.</p>
         <p>The Subject Files Series, 1926-1973, is mainly concerned with the internal functioning
            of the university, the history department, cultural life on campus, and faculty
            organizations. A number of student folders are filed in this section, under <title
               type="simple" render="doublequote">History Dept.: Students.</title> Nelson selected
            these particular folders to give examples of his grading system, to show some of his
            students' work, and to cover the span of Nelson's years at Duke. The folders of those
            students who achieved prominence are also included in this section.</p>
         <p>The Chamber Arts Society Series, 1945-1975, contains financial records, membership
            lists, programs, and correspondence. Nelson founded the Durham Chamber Arts Society in
            1945 to offer members of the Durham and Duke communities an opportunity to further their
            appreciation of the fine arts. The Chamber Arts Society began by presenting chamber
            music concerts in the East Duke Music Room at Duke University. Nelson was chairman of
            the Chamber Arts Society until 1963. </p>
         <p>Most of the Personal and Family Materials Series, 1913-1966, is made up of
            correspondence and concerns family matters, health problems, and descriptions of short
            excursions such as bicycle outings and shopping trips.</p>
         <p>Some of the correspondence includes information about current world events. In letters
            to Nelson, economics professor Calvin Bryce Hoover described life in the Soviet Union in
            1929, and the upcoming German elections in 1932. In 1939, Shelby McCloy described the
            reaction in France to the outbreak of World War II and faculty members' assignments
            during the war. In 1943, several Duke faculty members described the effects of the war
            on Duke University. Professor William B. Hamilton wrote about how teaching loads had
            greatly increased due to the large number of V-12 naval and marine cadets who were sent
            to Duke. Alan K. Manchester described the Navy syllabus used to teach World History and
            how the war changed civilian life. Several letters from William T. Laprade discussed the
            impact of the war on the history department and the effect of the draft on faculty. </p>
         <p>Nelson carried on lengthy correspondence with some of his students, many of whom either
            went abroad or entered graduate schools, and with a number of scholars at other
            institutions. Among these scholars are Carl Becker, Roland Bainton, Preserved Smith,
            George Lincoln Burr, Theodore Mommsen, and Hans Baron. </p>
         <p>A folder list is available as part of the collection file. Please consult University
            Archives staff.</p>
         <p>Box 1 and Box 6 are closed pending processing.</p>
         <p>Access to the folders containing student records is RESTRICTED. Please consult

               <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
               <p>Most of the Personal and Family Materials Series is made up of correspondence and
                  concerns family matters, health problems, and descriptions of short excursions
                  such as bicycle outings and shopping trips.</p>
               <p>Some of the correspondence includes information about current world events. In
                  letters to Nelson, economics professor Calvin Bryce Hoover described life in the
                  Soviet Union in 1929, and the upcoming German elections in 1932. In 1939, Shelby
                  McCloy described the reaction in France to the outbreak of World War II and
                  faculty members' assignments during the war. In 1943, several Duke faculty members
                  described the effects of the war on Duke University. Professor William B. Hamilton
                  wrote about how teaching loads had greatly increased due to the large number of
                  V-12 naval and marine cadets who were sent to Duke. Alan K. Manchester described
                  the Navy syllabus used to teach World History and how the war changed civilian
                  life. Several letters from William T. Laprade discussed the impact of the war on
                  the history department and the effect of the draft on faculty. </p>
               <p>Nelson carried on lengthy correspondence with some of his students, many of whom
                  either went abroad or entered graduate schools, and with a number of scholars at
                  other institutions. Among these scholars are Carl Becker, Roland Bainton,
                  Preserved Smith, George Lincoln Burr, Theodore Mommsen, and Hans Baron. </p>
