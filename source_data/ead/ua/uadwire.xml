      <p>Henry Rudolph Dwire was born in Winston-Salem, NC on October 8, 1882 to Henry Xenophon and
        Mary Hanes Dwire. He graduated from Trinity College with the A.B. degree in 1902 and with
        the M.A. degree in 1903. During his senior year, he was editor of The Archive. In 1904,
        Dwire became editor of the Twin City Sentinel, published out of Winston-Salem, and became
        known as one of the State's best-known editorial writers. During his lifetime, Dwire served
        on the Winston-Salem School Board and was a trustee for the North Carolina State Hospital
        for the Insane. He founded the Winston-Salem Fine Arts Foundation and in 1931 was director
        of the North Carolina Art Society. Dwire held State appointments under four successive North
        Carolina Governors and was a member of the State School Commission. He was managing editor
        of The South Atlantic Quarterly and editor of The Duke Alumni Register. He was director of
        the Duke University Press, University Vice President (1941) and Director of Public Relations
        and Alumni Affairs (at the time of his death) and served on numerous University committees.
        He was a member of Alpha Tau Omega, Omicron Delta Kappa, and Phi Beta Kappa. Davidson
        College awarded Dwire an Honorary Doctorate of Laws degree in 1943. He died in July
        1944.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
      <p>The collection contains Dwire's high school diploma, two certificates, correspondence,
        photographs, and clippings. The correspondence is congratulatory towards Dwire for his
        appointment as Duke University Vice President in 1941 and for the honorary degree he was
        awarded by Davidson College in 1943. Most of the photographs were taken at Davidson College.
        Most of the loose material was removed from a scrapbook after being transferred to the
        Archives in 1960. There is adhesive on many of the pages. The collection ranges in date from
        1897-1944.</p>
