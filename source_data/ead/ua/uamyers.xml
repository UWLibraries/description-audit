         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Hiram Earl Myers was a clergyman, theologian, and educator. Born in Anson County, near
            Wadesboro, N.C., in 1889, Myers attended Trinity College (A.B., 1911), Boston University
            School of Theology (S.T.B., 1920; S.T.M., 1926), University of Chicago and Chicago
            Theological Seminary (1936), Harvard Divinity School and the Episcopal Theological
            Seminary (1941). He received an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from Elon College
            (1950).</p>
         <p>Myers was ordained as a minister in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (1918) and
            served as pastor of the Trinity Methodist Church in Manchester, N.H. while attending
            Boston University. He also served at N.C. churches located in Graham, Salisbury,
            Elizabeth City, and Durham. </p>
         <p>Myers joined the Duke University faculty in 1926 as professor of biblical literature. He
            served as Chairman of the Department of Religion (1934-1936) and as Director of
            Undergraduate Studies in Religion (1937-1957). Myers stayed at Duke until his retirement
            in 1958.</p>
         <p>Myers was involved in a number of professional, civic, church, and honorary
            organizations including the National Association of Biblical Instructors, the American
            Association of University Professors, and Phi Beta Kappa.</p>
         <p>Myers married Rose Mae Warren in 1926. They had one daughter, Martha Rose.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection reflects Myers' activities as a clergyman and his thoughts on theological
            issues. The collection consists of correspondence; texts of sermons and Sunday School
            lessons; prayers given in Duke Chapel; records of sermons, baptisms, and marriages;
            notes on sermon topics; pamphlets; and other printed material. Major subjects include
            Myers' activities as a clergyman, his reflections on theological issues, and his
            involvement in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. </p>
         <p>The Writings and Speeches Series is an important part of the collection. It includes the
            typed and manuscript texts of approximately three hundred sermons and Sunday School
            lessons given by Myers throughout his career as a minister, prayers used in Duke Chapel,
            and other writings.</p>
         <p>The Correspondence Series includes correspondence with colleagues and family. Individual
            items of particular interest are letters from R.L. Flowers dealing with the aftermath of
            the deaths of James B. Duke and William Preston Few. Other correspondents include Sarah
            Pearson Duke, Josephus Daniels, Horace R. Kornegay, Sam J. Ervin, Jr., Y.E. Smith,
            William A. Erwin, and William B. Umstead. A few items within the correspondence deal
            with local Methodist affairs in the N.C. conference, particularly with ministerial
            appointments. Most of the correspondence is routine, although it occasionally reflects
            historical events such as the Great Depression and World War II.</p>
         <p>Other series in the collection include Personal and Family Papers, Pastoral Records,
            Lake Junaluska, Duke University, and Subject Files. </p>
         <p>Material directly related to Duke University is scanty. There are three folders of tests
            and examinations administered by Myers in his classes. Individual items of interest
            include Myers' reminiscences at the the 1960 alumni reunion and a copy of a poetic
            tribute to B. N. Duke by Wilbur F. Tillett of Vanderbilt University in 1928.</p>

               <p>Includes correspondence with colleagues and family. Individual items of particular
                  interest are letters from R.L. Flowers dealing with the aftermath of the deaths of
                  James B. Duke and William Preston Few. Other correspondents include Sarah Pearson
                  Duke, Josephus Daniels, Horace R. Kornegay, Sam J. Ervin, Jr., Y.E. Smith, William
                  A. Erwin, and William B. Umstead. A few items within the correspondence deal with
                  local Methodist affairs in the N.C. conference, particularly with ministerial
                  appointments. Most of the correspondence is routine, although it occasionally
                  reflects historical events such as the Great Depression and World War II.</p>
