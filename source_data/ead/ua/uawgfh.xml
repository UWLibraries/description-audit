      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>The Working Group in Feminism and History (WGFH) was founded in 1990 as the Feminist Women
        in History Group (FWHG). The group was formed by Judith Bennett, a faculty member in history
        at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Cymthia Herrup, a faculty member in
        history at Duke University, to provide support, discussion, and socializing for female
        graduate students and female faculty at Duke, UNC-CH, and other universities in the area.
        The group met several times per semester at the home of one of the faculty members to
        discuss scholarship and socialize. At least one or two meetings per year invited guest
        speakers or panelists to discuss a particular topic or work of scholarship, while other
        meetings provide an opportunity for group members to discuss their own scholarship.</p>
      <p>In 2003, the Feminist Women in History Group became the Working Group in Feminism and
        History, with some organizational changes. The group meets monthly during the academic year
        to discuss topics related to gender history, and is open to everyone.</p>
      <p>Organizational leadership in the group rotates each year. Some frequent organizers have
        included Judith Bennett of UNC-CH, Cynthia Herrup of Duke, Jacquelyn Hall of UNC-CH, Laura
        Edwards of UNC-CH and later Duke, and many others from both UNC-Chapel Hill and Duke
        University.</p>
