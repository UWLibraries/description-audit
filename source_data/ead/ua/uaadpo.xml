      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>On June 2, 1911, the Omicron Chapter of Alpha Delta Pi was the first sorority to install a
        national chapter on the Trinity College (now Duke University) campus. The six charter
        members were: Fannie Kilgo, Emma McCullen, Mildred Sinclair, Sally Smith, Annie St. George,
        and Lizzie Wren. Early members of Alpha Delta Pi were fortunate enough to live together in
        their first chapter house, Kilgo House. Mordecai House and Southgate Hall later housed the
        sorority. In 1930, chapter members moved into the dormitories around East campus and chose
        Bassett House, where they stayed until 1935. At that time the chapter room was moved into
        the Panhellenic House (now the East Campus Post Office). </p>
      <p> In 1951, Omicron sister Harriet Quillan reigned as the Alpha Delta Pi Centennial Queen. In
        October of 1986, the sorority celebrated its 75th anniversary with an elegant ball. All
        national officers, North Carolina Chapter Presidents, and Omicron Alumni were invited. At
        the 1987 National Summer Convention, President, Sister Morgan Massey accepted the highest
        scholastic award for a national chapter. At national conventions, the Omicron chapter has
        won the best pledge program award, the Efficiency Award, the Diamond Four Point Award, and
        many other awards for excellence. The Diamond Four Point signifies excellence in
        scholarship, leadership, popularity on campus, and talent. </p>
      <p> Alpha Delta Pi places high priority upon scholarship, service to the community, and
        personal development for each member. There are over 130 chapters throughout the United
        States and Canada offering programming in key areas such as leadership development,
        scholarship, alcohol and substance abuse awareness, and current health issues. Collegiate
        and alumnae members also support philanthropy which includes the Ronald McDonald House
        Charities. </p>
      <p> As of 2003, the Omicron chapter is governed by the Panhellenic Association at Duke
        University. The chapter does not currently have a chapter room on campus, but holds meetings
        in the Bryan Center. The sorority is currently active, with members living off-campus. </p>
