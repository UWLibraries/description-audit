         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>In late July 1981, Terry Sanford initiated negotiations with former president Richard
            Nixon (Duke Law 1937) to locate the Nixon presidential library on the campus of his alma
            mater. When this information was revealed to faculty members during the week of August
            10, 1981, many opposed the proposition as well as Sanford's failure to consult the
            faculty prior to initiating negotiations.</p>
         <p>Many who opposed the library had moral objections to memorializing a president whose
            behavior in office was reproachable, and they feared a negative effect on the
            university's reputation. Other concerns included the effects of greatly increased
            tourist traffic on campus and the aesthetic nature of the large proposed structure.
            However, supporters of erecting the Nixon Library on campus argued that the scholarly
            and academic benefits of locating the vast Nixon Presidential Materials collection on
            campus should and would outweigh any moral concerns. These supporters tended to denounce
            the actions of vocal dissenters as divisive and/or arrogant.</p>
         <p>Meetings of the Academic Council and Board of Trustees during September and October 1981
            were dominated by this debate, and a group of faculty formed the Committee Against the
            Nixon-Duke Library (CANDL) to organize the efforts of faculty, students, alumni, and
            others opposed to the proposed library. Although the Academic Council voted not to
            recommend further negotiations with Nixon in a 35-34 decision September 3, 1981, the
            Board of Trustees later voted 9-2 to proceed. By April 1982 negotiations had stalled,
            and a year later Nixon's representatives announced that a site at Chapman College in San
            Clemente, California, had been chosen for the Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
         <p>The bulk of dated materials from the Committee Against the Nixon-Duke Library spans the
            months of September through December 1981. The collection is composed primarily of
            correspondence, including the personal correspondence of Ruffin Slater and Prof. Norman
            Guttman, both on the CANDL Coordinating Committee, as well as active CANDL member Prof.
            J. David Barber. It also contains two folders of correspondence to the Committee,
            separated into letters of support for CANDL and letters of opposition to the Committee's
            goals. It contains one folder of confidential correspondence to Duke President Terry
            Sanford.</p>
         <p>The CANDL Records also contain some letter and advertisement drafts, as well handwritten
            notes on a variety on subjects, all of an unidentified author, most probably Slater or
            Guttman.</p>
         <p>The collection also contains letters mailed to faculty and alumni soliciting membership
            and donations, as well as periodic updates sent to CANDL members. Advertisements placed
            in local papers and flyers posted on campus are also included, as well as a humorous
            Watergate coloring book used to construct these ads.</p>
         <p>Membership information is organized into two folders. Faculty membership lists are
            arranged chronologically and are frequently divided into departmental lists.</p>
         <p>Financial Records are limited to incomplete handwritten expenditure and donation lists
            and a receipt from The Chronicle significant for its complete list of ads placed by
            CANDL in the campus newspaper.</p>
         <p>This collection also contains one folder of brochures and publications from other
            presidential libraries and museums, all ca. 1981, not duplicated in the Nixon Library
            Controversy Collection.</p>
         <p>For additional information, see also the Nixon Library Controversy Collection.</p>
