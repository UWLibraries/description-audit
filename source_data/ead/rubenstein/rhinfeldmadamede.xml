        grew up in a convent in France, where she was instructed in the construction of artificial
        flowers. She later used this skill to make a living in England. Collection comprises an
        handwritten, unpublished manuscript volume (256 written pages, plus 45 watercolor and 5 pen
        and ink plates of illustrations) by Madame de Rhinfeld, written around 1830. In the
        manuscript, Rhinfeld provides detailed instruction on how to create 24 different artificial
        flowers, and describes the tools used to make them. Flowers include pomegranate, hyacinth,
        roses, pansies, narcissus, geraniums, and orange flowers, among others. Includes watercolor
        diagrams regarding the construction of each flower, with additional paintings of the
        finished piece. The instructions are accompanied by a chapter of poetry, stories,
        quotations, and commentary related to each flower. Scattered throughout the manuscript are
        other pen and ink drawings. Includes an index to flowers and to poets.</abstract>
