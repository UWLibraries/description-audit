      <abstract id="aspace_ad877d6db61ec99d04c6c137f911a1c5">Mary "May" Morris was an English
        artisan, embroidery designer, jeweller, socialist, and editor. Collection comprises letters,
        an article, a few photographs, and several drawings. There are 16 letters and notes, dated
        1909-1931, addressed to "Ada," who was Ada Culmer, the companion/caregiver for May Morris'
        sister, Jenny. Fifteen of these items were written by May, with one by Jenny. Subjects range
        from personal matters to Kelmscott business, including May’s editing of her father’s
        collected works. Much of the content centers on mutual friends and relatives (with a focus
        on Jenny's ill health); several letters also mention foreign travel. The article, "Mrs.
        William Morris," The Athenaeum, 1914 Feb. 7, contains the author's memories of Jane Morris,
        following her death. There is an albumen photograph (4.25 x 5.75-inches) by Ernest Hall of
        Oxford, showing May Morris at work on one of her tapestries at Kelmscott, as well as a
        developing out paper copy by Haines of London of a 1905 Carter and Co. photograph (6 x
        4.25-inches) of Jane, May, and Jenny Morris, with Ada Culmer. In addition, there is a
        reproduction of a photograph of Kelmscott manor. Includes three undated reproductions of
        portraits of female figures.</abstract>
