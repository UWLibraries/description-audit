         <abstract id="aspace_9b1b1953fd898e63ff0e7daeb2c3aec4">The National Biscuit Company was
            founded in 1898, the product of a merger among the American Biscuit and Manufacturing
            Company, the New York Biscuit Company, and the United States Baking Company. The new
            conglomerate was headquartered in New York City with 114 bakeries across the United
            States. Over the next several decades the company grew by acquiring companies such as
            the F.H. Bennett Company, maker of Milk-Bone Pet Products, and the Shredded Wheat
            Company, maker of Triscuit Wafers and Shredded Wheat Cereal. The name "Nabisco" was
            first used as the name for a cracker introduced in 1901, but the corporate name did not
            change to Nabisco until 1971. The Uneeda Biscuit, National Biscuit Company's first
            packaged cracker, was the subject of the company's first million-dollar advertising
            campaign. Collection comprises a photograph album containing 129 gelatin silver prints
            and two cyanotypes by anonymous photographers. The majority of the photographs feature
            storefront and grocery displays of National Biscuit Company cookies and crackers,
            including Oreos, Animal Crackers, Fig Newtons, Graham Crackers, Uneeda Biscuits, among
            others. Several of the photographs indicate that the images were taken in Buffalo, New
            York, and many document the National Biscuit Company's sales force there, posed
            formally, attending sales meetings, or engaged together in leisure activities. The album
            also contains photographs of horse drawn delivery wagons, a display for Milk Bone dog
            biscuits, children dressed in costumes that promote company products, and a classroom of
            children "playing store."</abstract>
