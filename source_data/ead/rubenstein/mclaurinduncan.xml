            teacher, lawyer, and state legislator of Richmond County, North Carolina.
            Correspondence, bills, receipts, legal and other papers, and printed matter (1822-1872),
            of McLaurin and members of his family. McLaurin's papers (mainly 1822-1850) relate to
            economic conditions in North Carolina, South Carolina, and the U.S. in general; the
            development of infrastructure and education in North and South Carolina; the Civil War;
            politics in North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia; and
            national politics, including presidential elections from 1832 to 1848. Civil War topics
            include camp life, economic conditions, food supplies, the hope for foreign
            intervention, morale, conscription and desertion, the blockade of Southern ports, the
            battles of Murfreesboro (Tennessee), Jackson (Mississippi), Port Royal Harbor (South
            Carolina), Hanover Court House (Virginia), and the siege of Vicksburg (Mississippi). A
            large amount of correspondence from relatives in Mississippi (circa 1830-1867) concerns
            frontier conditions, slavery, politics, agricultural and labor problems, sectionalism
            and nationalism in Mississippi, Reconstruction conditions, and family affairs. There are
            many references to slavery, particularly in Mississippi: the sale of slaves, runaway
            slaves, a lynching of an African American in 1839, the fear of slave insurrections in
            1856 and 1860; and the abolition movement. Includes an atlas with a list of slaves circa
            1864 written on the flyleaf.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>The McLaurin collection centers around Duncan McLaurin (1787-1872), a teacher, lawyer,
            state legislator, and farmer of Richmond County, North Carolina. Much of the
            correspondence involves his only brother. John McLaurin (d. 1864), and eight sisters:
            Mary (d. 1869), Effy (d. 1861), Polly (d. l860s), Barbara McKenzie (d. l855), Elizabeth
            (d. 1860), Jeanny McCall, Sarah Douglas (d. 1860s), and Isabel Patterson (d. 1860s), and
            their children.</p>
         <p>During the 1820s Duncan McLaurin was engaged in a law practice in his home county, and
            by 1831 was a member of the state legislature. In 1834 he accepted a teaching position
            at an academy in Bennettsville, S.C. He remained here until 1837, when the failing
            health of his father forced him to return home and resume his law practice. The next
            year he was back in the legislature, and during 1841-1842 he was postmaster at Laurel
            Hill. By 1853, however, he was in his sixties, and was looking far an assistant to
            manage his affairs. He never married, but lived with a succession of nieces and
            nephews.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Personal and political correspondence, legal papers, bills and receipts, and printed
            material comprise the papers of Duncan McLaurin (1787-1872). Correspondence, including
            many letters from friends and relatives who migrated to Mississippi, discusses the
            forced removal of the Choctaw Indians; wars with tribes in Georgia and Alabama; economic
            conditions, especially the panics of 1837 and 1857; the Bank of the United States; banks
            and currency; cotton production, markets, and prices. There are many references to
            slavery, particularly in Mississippi: the sale of slaves, runaway slaves, a lynching of
            an African American in 1839, the fear of slave insurrections in 1856 and 1860; and the
            abolition movement. There are also references to the annexation of California; land
            prices and speculation; the growth of religious denominations in Mississippi and
            Louisiana; the development of schools in Mississippi, Georgia, and North Carolina, and
            of Wake Forest Institute (Wake Forest, North Carolina), and Union Seminary (Richmond,
            Virginia); the temperance movement; the early development of railroads, roads, and
            canals in North Carolina; politics in North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi,
            Alabama, and Georgia; and national politics, including presidential elections,
            1832-1848. </p>
         <p>Civil War topics in the correspondence include camp life, economic conditions, food
            supplies, the hope for foreign intervention, morale, conscription and desertion, the
            blockade of Southern ports, the battles of Murfreesboro (Tennessee), Jackson
            (Mississippi), Port Royal Harbor (South Carolina), and Hanover Court House (Virginia),
            and the siege of Vicksburg (Mississippi); economic conditions and Reconstruction
            government in Mississippi; and difficulties with sharecroppers and debtors.</p>
         <p>Legal papers consist of deeds, contracts, wills, court orders, and, after 1850, papers
            pertaining to the wardship of his sister, Isabel Patterson, and her children after her
            mental breakdown. Miscellaneous printed items include an atlas, 1835, with a list of
            slaves dating from the end of the war written on the flyleaf; a memorial to the North
            Carolina state legislature from the Society of Friends, 1832; a reply to President
            Jackson's proclamation on nullification; a report of the treasurer of the University of
            North Carolina to the trustees, 1839; a report of the Merchants Bank of New Bern, the
            Bank of the State of North Carolina, and the Bank of Cape Fear, 1838; a North Carolina
            Republican campaign circular, 1873; <title type="simple" render="italic">The Prison
               News</title>, Raleigh, North Carolina, for March 1, 1932; and other various items.
