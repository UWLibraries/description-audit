            Staunton, Va. Collection comprises a photgraph album probably compiled by Hamrick, who
            built trestles and railroad bridges all over the South. Includes 339 photographs,
            including 333 black-and-white gelatin prints (possibly matte collodion prints), as well
            as 6 cyanotypes, primarily of concrete-and-metal bridges constructed in Mississippi,
            Louisiana, Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Alabama, as well as a few shots of
            construction sites in British Columbia. Many of the images, but not all, contain brief
            identifying markings made in pencil or pen on the surface of the photograph. Sizes range
            from 3"x2.5" to 4.5"x6.5, with several attempts by Hamrick to create "panoramic" views
            by pasting two images together. Large sections of the album are devoted to the Whitney
            and South Fork bridges in North Carolina, but topics generally include construction
            scenes in various stages of completion; work crews, engineers, and surveying teams;
            camps and homesteads used as residences, and family life there. The majority of the
            photographs date between 1903 and 1914, with only 3 shots dating from 1946. There are
            also images taken during excursions; for instance, to St. Augustine, Fla.; Mardi Gras in
            New Orleans (1906); and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis (1904). There are
            also unidentified groups of young people, including possibly a women's school,
            "Rockdale" (in Ga.?), as well as a few clearly marked images of parties and a football
            game at Virginia Polytechnical Institute.</abstract>
