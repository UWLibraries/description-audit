      <p>William Clarence Hollopeter was born in Muncy, Pennsylvania, and worked as a physician in
        Philadelphia from 1877-1917. He attended the University at Lewisburg, now Bucknell
        University, and recieved his medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1877.
        After completing medical school, Hollopeter worked as an intern at the Presbyterian Hospital
        and then studied under and worked as an assistant to George Strawbridge, who was an ear,
        nose, and throat specialist. Hollopeter went on to work as an attending physician at the
        Methodist Episcopal Hospital, as Professor of Pediatrics at the Medico-Chirurgical College,
        as Pediatrist and Attending Physician at St. Joseph's Hospital, and as Attending Physician
        in Children's Diseases at the Philadelphia Hospital. Additionally, Dr. Hollopeter is the
        author of "Hay Fever, Its Prevention and Cure." He was married to Sara Adelaide Root
        (b.1858-1937), and they had four children: two sons who died in childhood (Paul and
        William), one son who died in 1912 from pneumonia at age 29 (Ralph), and a daughter, Sara
        Marguerite (b.1896).</p>
