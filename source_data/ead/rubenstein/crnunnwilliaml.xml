      <p>Consumer Reports is a product testing and consumer advocacy nonprofit organization based in
        Yonkers, N.Y., founded in 1936. William L. Nunn was an economist active in labor issues,
        officer in the American Civil Liberties Union and the first Director of University Relations
        at the University of Minnesota.</p>
      <p>William Lee Nunn was born in 1902 in Georgia. He graduated form Oglethorpe University (AB,
        ecoonomics, 1922) and taught at Oito College in Japan (1922-1926) before returning to
        graduate studies at Columbia University (MA 1927). Nunn taught at the University of
        Pittsburgh (1927-1929) before being fired for radical associations. He later taught at New
        York University, Dana College, Newark University (Now Rutgers University, 1929-1945), and
        served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Nunn served on the National Committee of the
        American Civil Liberties Union and became the first Director of University Relations at the
        University of Minnesota in 1945 where he served until his retirement in 1971. He died in
        1991. </p>
