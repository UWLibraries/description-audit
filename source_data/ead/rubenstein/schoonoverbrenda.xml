            ambassador to Togo (1998-2000) and the interim ambassador to Belgium (2003-2004).
            Accession (2009-0259) (1000 items; 2.1 lin. ft.; 1994-2008) consists largely of speech
            files and other items created by Schoonover during the latter part of her career in the
            U.S. Foreign Service, including her ambassadorship to Togo, her time as
            Diplomat-in-Residence at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and her
            subsequent post as Charge d'Affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Belgium, where she became
            interim ambassador in 2003. Speech topics range from international diplomacy, the Peace
            Corps, September 11th, trade, foreign relations, and West Africa development. Also
            included are media articles, the majority from Belgium newspapers in 2003-2004;
            miscellaneous photographs and letters; and numerous videocassettes documenting
            ceremonies and programs during her time in Togo. Acquired as part of the John Hope
            Franklin Research Center for African and African American History and
            Culture.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Brenda Schoonover was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and attended Morehouse College. She
            was a charter member of the Peace Corps, which sent her to the Philippines in 1961.
            After her volunteer service, she continued to work for the Peace Corps in a variety of
            capacities. She also worked for Arlington County, Virginia, as the county's affirmative
            action officer in the 1970s.</p>
         <p>Schoonover met and married her husband, Richard (Dick) Schoonover, during her time in
            Africa. He was a Foreign Service officer in the United States Information Agency. She
            joined the Foreign Service as well and worked in a variety of administrative positions
            in the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, and for the Bureau of Near East and South Asian
            Affairs. Schoonover was the Chief of Personnel for the Bureau of European and Canadian
            Affairs from 1988-1991, and was the Deputy Director for the Office of Joint
            Administrative Services at the U.S. Embassy in Belgium from 1992-1996.</p>
         <p>In 1997, Schoonover participated in the State Department's Senior Seminar, a highly
            selective professional development program for senior foreign policy and national
            security officers. She subsequently participated in the National Defense University's
            Capstone Program for military officers and their civilian equivalents.</p>
         <p>She was appointed by President Bill Clinton as the U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of
            Togo in January 1998, where she served until July 2000. </p>
         <p>Following her ambassadorship, Schoonover spent a year at the Univerisity of North
            Carolina at Chapel Hill as a State Department Diplomat-in-Residence, where she taught
            classes, led discussions, and promoted study abroad.</p>
         <p>She began a three-year tour as the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in
            Belgium in 2001. In 2003, Ambassador Stephen Brauer left the post, and the intended
            replacement, Jeffrey Marcus, was forced to withdraw from consideration for personal
            reasons. Schoonover served as the interim ambassador until 2004, when Tom C. Korologos
            assumed the post. Schoonover then retired from the Foreign Service and returned to
            Chapel Hill, North Carolina, with her husband.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>This collection is divided into 4 series: <emph render="bold">Speeches and
               writings</emph>, <emph render="bold">Media coverage</emph>, <emph render="bold"
               >Miscellaneous materials</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Videotapes</emph>. The
            materials all date from the latter part of Schoonover's career, especially focusing on
            her time at UNC Chapel Hill and at the American Embassy in Belgium.</p>
         <p>The majority of this collection consists of the texts of speeches, public remarks, and
            presentations made by Schoonover, beginning in 1997 with a few items from her Senior
            Seminar studies in Washington, D.C. Materials from her years in Togo are fairly light,
            with only a few embassy speeches. Her time as Diplomat-in-Residence at Chapel Hill and
            as Charge d'Affaires at the Belgium Embassy are strongly represented, with a variety of
            speeches discussing her Togo ambassadorship, conditions in West Africa, terrorism (both
            the Kenyan embassy bombings and September 11th), trade missions, and her Peace Corps
            experiences. Her remarks also reference her embassy activities in Belgium, both as
            Deputy Chief of Mission and interim ambassador. Audiences include Fulbright recipients
            and committees, the American-Belgium Association, schools and students, and businessmen.
            There are special speeches for Armistace Day and Flanders Field, as well as the Marine
            Corps anniversary celebration.</p>
         <p>Videotapes make up another significant portion of the collection, and the majority deal
            with Schoonover's ambassadorship in Togo. Most appear to be recordings of her
            participation in ceremonies and events, including her presentation of credentials,
            receptions, interviews, and press conferences.</p>
         <p>The media coverage of Schoonover covers her time in Togo, Chapel Hill, and Belgium, with
            the majority of the materials being from Belgian coverage of her interim
            ambassadorship.</p>
         <p>The miscellaneous materials series includes official portraits, photographs, and
            certificates of Schoonover in various events and ceremonies; a booklet that she wrote
            about her aunt's life in 2008; and miscellaneous letters and brochures, dating from
            1994-2004.</p>
