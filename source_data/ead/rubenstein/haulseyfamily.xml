        memorandum book maintained by the Haulsey family of London, England, from 1646-1846. The
        memoranda usually record marriages, births, christenings, deaths, and burials, but there are
        also separate notes on family genealogy, as well as a few notes on land tenancy transfers,
        and money lent and received. There is one record regarding numbers of silver trays and
        candlesticks. Volume entries are handwritten on varying types of paper, and are not in
        chronological order. The volume also features an embroidered binding and a metal-clasp
        closure with initials G.W. (one clasp is missing). The embroidery includes images of day and
        night, as well as a dog, monkey, church, house, windmill, swallow, snail, and various plants
        and flowers.</abstract>
