         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Established in September 2003, the Doris Duke Oral History Collection is part of the
            Doris Duke Charitable Foundation Historical Archives which were donated to the David M.
            Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation.
            The collection documents the testimonies of staff at Duke Farms, at Shangri La, and of
            close, personal friends of Doris Duke. At present, there are 35 interviews available for
            research.</p>
         <p>The oral histories covers the period 1998 to 2009, and is divided into 4 series: Duke
            Farms, Shangri La, Newport Restoration Foundation, and Administrative Records. In most
            cases each interview has several components including the original recording of the
            interview on cassette tape, transcripts (which includes release form, correspondence,
            and verbatim, edited and final transcripts), and an access copy of both the transcript
            and interview. For a majority of the interviews, digital copies of the interviews and
            transcripts are available in the Rubenstein Library reading room.</p>
         <p>This collection is currently restricted and requires prior approval by the Doris Duke
            Charitable Foundation to use.</p>

               <p>This series consists of interviews of those individuals who either worked for, had
                  a relative that worked for, or were friends with Doris Duke at the Duke Farms
                  estate from the 1930s to the time of her death in 1993. The topics of the
                  interviews vary, but in general provide insight to living and working on the
                  estate, and in particular what it was like working for Miss Duke. The interviews
                  are organized by oral history number.</p>

                  <p>In 1964, Mr. Dingwall accepted an invitation from the Duke organization to

                     discusses his experiences as Managing Director, working with Miss Duke, and a
                     variety of other individuals. He also discusses the challenges involved with

                  <p>Interview date: 2004 Feb 2</p>
                  <p>By the early 1950s, Jerome Eaton had joined the Horticultural Society of New
                     York and became a Board Member. It was through his association with the HSNY
                     that he first came into contact with Doris Duke. Mr. Eaton assisted Miss Duke
                     as she sought to transform greenhouses on her Somerville estate into more
                     useful gardens. Mr. Eaton speaks about his relationship with Miss Duke and his
                     efforts to construct the Duke Gardens.</p>

                  <p>Russell Shaffer begins the first part of the interview by providing some
                     background information on his father, Irving Shaffer. The senior Shaffer first
                     came to Duke Farms in the early 20th century as a herdsman and quickly rose to
                     become Assistant Superintendent. Mr. Shaffer continues the interview by
                     discussing certain activities and individuals who were associated with the Farm
                     during his tenure there and reference's Nanaline Duke's dislike for the estate
                     as the reason why construction was never completed. He ends the interview by
                     detailing operations in the greenhouses, such as the improvements made to the
                     new greenhouse in the late 1930s.</p>

               <p>This series consists of two interviews. Both interviewees worked for the Newport
                  Restoration Foundation (NRF) in Newport, RI. Marion Oates Charles was also a close
                  friend of Doris Duke. The topics of the interviews vary, but in general provide
                  insight to living and working for the NRF, Miss Duke's involvement in the
                  foundation, and particular for Ms. Charles, what it was like knowing Miss Duke.
                  The interviews are organized by oral history number.</p>

                  <p>Marion Oates Charles, “Oatsie,” discusses her early contact with Doris Duke and
                     the extent of Miss Duke’s social activities in Newport. She explains the
                     history behind the creation of the Newport Restoration Foundation (NRF), the
                     role of its Trustees (of which she is one), and why Miss Duke eventually
                     stopped acquiring homes for the NRF.</p>
