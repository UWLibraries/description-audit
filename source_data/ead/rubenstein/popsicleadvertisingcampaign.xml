         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The Popsicle was invented by accident when, at age 11, Frank Epperson left a cup of soda
            water with stirring stick outdoors during freezing temperatures. In adulthood, Epperson
            sold his frozen invention at fairs, and initially called it the <emph
               render="doublequote">Epsicle.</emph> His children referred it <emph
               render="doublequote">Pop's sicle</emph> and the product's name was subsequently
            changed to <emph render="doublequote">Popsicle</emph>.</p>
         <p>In 1923, Epperson applied for a patent for <emph render="doublequote">frozen ice on a
               stick.</emph> In 1925, he sold the rights to his invention to the Joe Lowe Company of
            New York. At this point, the Lowe Company entered into an agreement with the Good Humor
            Company not to use either milk-based recipes, or rectangular designs, in order to
            minimize product competition. In 1932 the Good Humor Company sued Joe Lowe and Popsicle
            for infringing on this agreement, noting that Popsicle products had begun to encroach
            upon Good Humor's products in the shapes and amount of milk used.</p>
         <p>Originally, popsicles were offered in seven different flavors. The <emph
               render="doublequote">twin</emph> Popsicle was invented during the Great Depression,
            an era in which the product's sales increased. During the 1950s, as freezers became more
            common in suburban households, the Popsicle multipack started to be sold in
            supermarkets. In 1965, Popsicle was purchased by Consolidated Foods Corporation and
            again in 1986 by the Gold Bond Ice Cream Company of Green Bay, Wisconsin. In 1989
            Unilever acquired Gold Bond, which owned both Breyers and Good Humor brands along with
            Popsicle; Unilever's ice cream division became known as Gold Bond-Good Humor. In 1993,
            this name changed to Good Humor-Breyers. </p>

            Company, prior to its purchase by Consolidated Foods (the brand is currently owned by
