        photographer, author, and educator, traveled to Moscow from 1990-1992 to conduct more than
        seventy interviews and to photograph former Soviet airwomen who served during World War II
        as pilots, gunners, bombardiers, navigators, and flight crews. The 36 black-and-white
        portraits in this collection show the women seated and standing, most in a studio setting;
        they are in civilian clothing and many are wearing their wartime medals and military
        insignia. The gelatin silver photographs were printed by Noggle and measure 20x24 (8), 16x20
        (6), and 11x14 (22) inches. Almost all appear in her book <title render="italic">A Dance
          with Death: Soviet Airwomen in World War II</title>, published in 1994, also held by the
        library. Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</abstract>

      <p>Collection consists of 36 black-and-white photographic portraits taken by photographer Anne
        Noggle of former Soviet airwomen who served during World War II as combat pilots, gunners,
        bombardiers, navigators, and flight crews. The women are seated and standing, most in a
        studio setting; they are dressed in civilian clothing and many are wearing their wartime
        medals and military insignia. The gelatin silver photographs were printed by Noggle and are
        sized 20x24 (8), 16x20 (6), and 11x14 (22) inches. Almost all the images appear in her book
          <title render="italic">A Dance with Death: Soviet Airwomen in World War II</title>,
        published in 1994, and also held by the library. </p>
      <p>From the Texas A&amp;M Press website for the book: "The women who tell their stories here
        began the war mostly as inexperienced girls — many of them teenagers. In support of their
        homeland, they volunteered to serve as bomber and fighter pilots, navigator-bombardiers,
        gunners, and support crews. Flying against the Luftwaffe, they saw many of their friends —
        as well as many of their foes — fall to earth in flames. Their three combat Air Force
        regiments fought as many as one thousand missions during the war... equally courageous were
        the women's efforts to show the Red Army that they were entirely adequate to the great role
        they sought. For even though Stalin had decreed equality for both sexes, the women had to
        grapple initially with deep distrust from male pilots and Red Army officers, against whom
        they eventually prevailed."</p>
