            of St. Louis, Missouri, was the youngest of six children and the only son of Col. Alonzo
            W. Slayback (1838-1882) and Alice A. Waddell (1839-). The collection includes two
            diaries kept by Alonzo William Slayback from 1898 to 1901. The first diary consists of
            17 double-sided pages of remarks fastened with a metal brad to several small slips of
            paper that serve as an index. The 43 numbered remarks, which range in date from October
            20, 1898, to August 19, 1899, and undated, describe Slayback's conversations,
            encounters, and dates with several different women. The second diary, a small account
            book from the Merchant's National Bank of St. Louis, contains 42 pages of letters
            addressed to V, Veda, or Olga; the woman Slayback loved whose fickleness elicited
            passionate and conflicted feelings in him. Eighteen letters are dated from December 4,
            1899, to November 16, 1901. Together, the diaries provide insight into dating and
            courtship in St. Louis, Mo., at the end of the 19th century.</abstract>

         <p>Alonzo William Slayback (d. 1969), born in St. Louis, Missouri, on September 21, 1879,
            was the youngest of six children and the only son of Col. Alonzo William Slayback
            (1838-1882) and Alice Amelia Waddell (1839-). His well-known father, a lawyer, colonel
            in the Confederate Army, and candidate for U.S. Representative from Missouri in 1876,
            was shot and killed by John Cockerill, editor of the <title type="simple"
