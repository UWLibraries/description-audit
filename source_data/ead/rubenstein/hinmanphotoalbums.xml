            with small and large images primarily documenting George Warren and Kate Rumsey Hinman's
            travels and missionary work in central China. Most of the photographs were taken in
            Fuzhou (Foochow) and Shaowu, Fujian Province, where the Hinmans were assigned. The
            images are accompanied by detailed captions, and feature missionaries, mission and
            church buildings, Chinese preachers, local officials, children, river scenes,
            landscapes, and landmarks. There are also a few images of the Burrell School in Selma,
            Alabama, and two ministers in Michigan. The photographs are typically mounted one to a
            page, and are chiefly a mix of gelatin and collodion prints, with a few albumen prints
            included.</abstract>

         <p>Two late 19th-century photograph albums primarily documenting George Warren and Kate
            Rumsey Hinman's travels and missionary work in central China. Most of the photographs
            were taken in Fuzhou (Foochow) and Shaowu, Fujian Province, where the Hinmans were
            assigned. </p>
         <p>The earliest images, in Album 1, are of the Rev. George Stillwell of Garden, Michigan
            and the Rev. E. G. Palmer and family of Oxford, Michigan. A series of images of
            buildings, staff and students of the Burrell School in Selma, Alabama are also found in
            Album 1, as well as a few larger images from China. The black-and-white photographs in
            this album appear to be a mix of albumen and collodion or gelatin prints.</p>
         <p>Album 2 contains 57 black-and-white photographs taken in China, Fujian Province, chiefly
            in Fuzhou (Foochow) and Shaowu, where the Hinmans were assigned. There are portraits of
            local officials, river scenes, and other landscapes. Other locations seem to be mostly
            in Fujian Province, and include the Ing Hok River, Ing Tai; Yeng Bing (?), a location
            near Fuzhou; Guling (Kuliang), a mountain location near Fuzhou, where the Hinmans stayed
            in a cottage; and landmarks such as monasteries, city gates, and the Bridge of 10,000
            Ages in Fuzhou (also found in the Sidney Gamble photographs collection at Duke). The
            photographs in this album appear to be primarily collodion and gelatin prints.</p>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>George Warren Hinman was born in Baraboo, Sauk County, Wisconsin, Feb. 22, 1869, of
            missionary parents. He graduated from Oberlin in 1893 and from Harvard seminary in 1898.
            He married Kate Rumsey Bailey in 1893 in Moreland, New York, her home region. Appointed
            by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in 1898, the Hinmans left
            for China on December 24, 1898. According to a postcard sent by George Hinman to the
            Central Church in Fall River, Massachusetts, who sponsored their missionary work, they
            arrived in Yokohama, Japan, January 16, 1899. They continued their missionary work in
            China into the 1900s. Later they moved to California.</p>
