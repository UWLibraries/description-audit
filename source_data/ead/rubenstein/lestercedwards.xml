      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Charles Edwards Lester was an American author and diplomat. Lester was born in Griswold,
        Connecticut, a descendant of Jonathan Edwards. He was of a roving disposition and traveled
        widely in the United States and Europe. He was admitted to the bar in Mississippi and later
        was ordained a minister in the Presbyterian church. In 1840, he addressed antislavery
        meetings in Massachusetts and was elected a delegate to the London antislavery conference of
        that year. He did not return to the United States after the close of the conference but
        remained in England. His The Glory and Shame of England, published in New York in 1841,
        criticized England's antislavery professions. In 1842, President Tyler appointed Lester
        United States Consul at Genoa.</p>
