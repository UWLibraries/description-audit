      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Charles Nordhoff (31 August 1830 - 14 July 1901) was an American journalist, descriptive
        and miscellaneous writer. He was born in Erwitte, Germany (Prussia) in 1830, and emigrated
        to the United States with his parents in 1835. He was educated in Cincinnati, and
        apprenticed to a printer in 1843. In 1844, he went to Philadelphia where he worked for a
        short time in a newspaper office, but then joined the United States Navy, where he served
        three years and made a voyage around the world. After his Navy service, he remained at sea
        in the whaling, mackerel fishery and merchant service until 1853. From 1853 to 1857, he
        worked in various newspaper offices, first in Philadelphia, then in Indianapolis. He was
        then employed editorially by Harpers until 1861, when he went to work the next ten years on
        the staff of the New York Evening Post, and he later contributed to the New York Tribune.
        From 1871 to 1873 Nordhoff traveled in California and visited Hawaii. He then became
        Washington correspondent of the New York Herald. Nordhoff died in San Francisco,
        California.</p>
