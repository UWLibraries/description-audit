            Representative from Orangeburg, S.C. Correspondence, business and legal papers, and
            printed matter, mostly dating from 1855-1900, centered on South Carolina history. All
            pre-1850 papers are legal documents concerned with land surveys and transfers. A few
            letters written while Dibble was a Confederate soldier relate to the home front; postwar
            correspondence deals with such matters as phosphate mining, education, professional
            activities, African Americans in post-Reconstruction politics, and Dibble's opposition
            to Governor Tillman. Later papers display his expanding activities in banking and
            railroads. After 1900 the papers concern brother A. C. Dibble, and sons L. V., an
            insurance agent, and Samuel Jr., a surveyor and civil engineer.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Correspondence, business and legal papers, and printed matter, mostly dating from
            1855-1900, centered on South Carolina history. All pre-1850 papers are legal documents
            concerned with land surveys and transfers. From 1869-1872 there are a number of
            documents relating to the state's pooicy of buying large estates for resale in small
            sections; included are descriptions of estates, prices, and approval by state cabinet
            members. Further light is thrown on this policy by the records of an investigating
            committee, 1877.</p>
         <p>A few letters written while Dibble was a Confederate soldier relate entirely to the home
            front in S.C. rather than to his service; letters refer to assessments and requisitions.
            Postwar correspondence deals with such matters as phosphate mining, education, and
            professional activities. Later papers display Dibble's expanding activities in banking
            and railroads.</p>
         <p>Dibble was state chairman in 1892 of the "Conservative Democracy of S.C." and was
            leading the opposition to hte renomination of Gov. Tillman. There are a number of
            undated voter censuses of both black and white voters in various precincts in the
            Orangeburg County area. In several letters from the 1880s there are comments about the
            role of African Americans in post-Reconstruction voting and politics.</p>
         <p>Dibble was a lawyer for a phosphate mining company, thus there is abundant information
            on legal cases such as territoriality claims, but also on equipment used, amount mined,
            and methods of mining. Dibble was often called to legal cases concerning estates,
            therefore the collection houses the wills of William R. Treadwell (1863), George H.
            Pooser (1866), David W. Snell (1879), and Chrisian A. Gates. There is also information
            about the family of Langdon Cheves in letters of Nov. 18, 1879, and March 22, 1879.
            After 1900 the papers concern brother A. C. Dibble, and sons L. V., an insurance agent,
            and Samuel Jr., a surveyor and civil engineer.</p>
         <p>The miscellaneous papers include surveyors' notebooks, printed legal cases in which
            Dibble was involved (particularly in the Supreme Court), speeches by members of
            Congress, Dibble's business notebooks, railroad timetables, and other print
            material.</p>
