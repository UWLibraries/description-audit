         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection consists of a single autograph manuscript note (dated 1963 October 6)
            from the French composer and conductor Nadia Boulanger to a sick friend identified as
            "R.I." It's likely that the recipient was the conductor Robert Irving. Boulanger
            inquires as to what advice he's received from his doctors, and mentions her own recent
            illness. She says that her faith has "brought moral relief to the physical suffering."
            She asks after his plans and hopes for the future, "in spite of all that makes regular
            work so difficult." Boulanger writes her address at the bottom of the note: 35 Rue
            Ballu, Paris IX.</p>
