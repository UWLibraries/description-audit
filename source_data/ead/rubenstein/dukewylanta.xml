        (nÃ©e Rochelle, 1881-1980) was the daughter of Durham merchant Leander Sydney and Jeanette

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Wylanta Rochelle was likely born in 1881, although her birthdate is sometimes listed as
        1882 or 1883, to her parents: Durham merchant Sydney Leander Rochelle and his wife, Jeanette
        Rochelle. On 11 June 1910, Wylanta, then 19 years old, married the 63-year old Brodie L.
        Duke (1846-1919), becoming his fourth and final wife. Duke and Rochelle were married in
        Camden, N.J. by Justice of the Peace Frank Garrison only one day after a Presbyterian
        minister in Washington D.C. refused to marry the couple due to Duke's two previous
        divorces.</p>
      <p>Duke died on 2 February 1919 at the age of 73, and Wylanta continued to manage the couple's
        property affairs and use his surname until she married her second husband, Isaac Richardson
        Strayhorn (1889-1923), an attorney from Hillsboro with an office at 205 E. Main St., likely
        in 1920. On 3 September 1923, Strayhorn died in Nice, France from injuries inflicted by a
        motor vehicle accident in which Wylanta and others were also injured in late August of that
        year.</p>
      <p>By August 1930, Wylanta had married Connor Woodward Aycock (1893-1941), the son of former
        North Carolina governor (1901-1905), Charles Brantley Aycock. Connor passed away on 12
        October 1941, and Wylanta married her fourth husband, 39-year old Perry Clayton Eldridge
        (1903-1956), a former teacher and a sales repesentative for Standard Oil, one year later, in
        1942. The marriage was short-lived, and Wylanta and Eldridge divorced one year later, in
        1943.</p>
      <p>On 22 October 1949, Wylanta married her fifth and final husband, Thomas Michael Holt. The
        couple divorced in 1954. Wylanta died in 1980 at the age of 99, using the name Wylanta
        Rochelle Holt on her tombstone. It is unclear how many children, if any, Wylanta had.</p>
      <p>Wylanta, through both her family and her husbands, owned a number of properties in Durham,
        many of them located on North Magnum Street, which she frequently rented.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Wylanta Duke Strayhorn Aycock Holt papers date from 1889 to 1980, with the bulk of the
        materials from the 1920s and 1930s. The collection chronicles Wylanta's familial and social
        life as well as her business dealings.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> contains primarily incoming
        correspondence from Wylanta's sister, Hettie, nieces and nephews, and husbands as well as
        letters to and from a wide range of friends and Durham citizens. It contains a number of
        holiday greeting and sympathy cards, but does not contain any correspondence explicitly
        addressed to Brodie L. Duke.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Clippings Series</emph> includes excerpts from newspaper columns
        and articles which Wylanta collected throughout her life. These clippings include the
        regular opinion column written by Wylanta's brother, Zapheus A. Rochelle, notes from the
        society section chronicling Wylanta and others' visits and travels, and coverage of Wylanta
        and Stayhorn's 1923 motor vehicle accident in Nice, France, as well as other political and
        social subjects.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Financial Records Series</emph> encompasses deposit slips,
        receipts, dividend notices, ledgers, and correspondence evidencing Wylanta's business
        transactions. The series also contains information about her property ownership in the city
        of Durham.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Miscellaneous Series</emph> contains assorted handwritten notes and
        printed commercial images.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Photographs Series</emph> includes a number of portraits of
        Wylanta, her husbands and her family as well as numerous images of as-yet unidentified
        individuals. The materials include images of Wylanta in her wedding gowns, snapshots, and
        portraits. There are also a handful of images of places and an early x-ray of Wylanta's arm
        following an accident.</p>

          <p>The correspondence series contains primarily greeting and Christmas cards sent to
            Wylanta during her lifetime. The bulk of the correspondence is from the late 1920s.
            These notes are addressed to Wylanta according to her current married surname and
            generally express holiday greetings, well wishes, and, occasionally, thank her for gifts
            or sympathy sentiments received, invite her to weddings and other events, or request
            charitable gifts. Many of these greeting cards have no handwritten notes other than a
            signature. More in-depth are a handful of letters between Wylanta and her sister, Hettie
            (primarily from 1900-1925, Hettie Rochelle Blankenship lived 1893-1979), her future
            husband, Perry Elridge, and several other female friend correspondents. Topics addressed
            in these notes including current events such as World Wars I and II, love, business and
            property rental issues, Wylanta's winter home in Miami Beach, Durham society gossip, and
            family matters. There are also a small number of letters from merchants in response to
            Wylanta's requests for purchases. From 1923 there is a large amount of correspondence
            and condolence letters related to Wylanta's car accident in Nice, France, after which
            her husband, Isaac R. Strayhorn, died from injuries sustained. The correspondence series
            is organized chronologically.</p>

            Rochelle, Wylanta's brother, and articles related to Wylanta's family or the families of
            her husbands. The "Wylanta &amp; Family" folder contains newspaper records of her visits
            and calls with family and friends, her vacations, marriages, and purchases of
            properties, and other instances wherein Wylanta's name was printed. Also included are
            copies of the New York Herald from 21-23 August 1923 which chronicle the car accident in
            Nice, France, after which Wylanta's second husband, Isaac R. Strayhorn, died from
            injuries. This series is organized by subject.</p>

          <p>The photographs series contains a number of black and white photographs. Many of these
            images show Wylanta at various stages of life, including portraits of her wearing
            several of her wedding gowns. Other photographs show individual and group portraits of
            Wylanta's husbands, siblings, and other family members, as well as a large number of
            as-yet unidentified individuals. A woman with glasses appears frequently in these
            images, and is likely Wylanta's sister Hettie. There are two photographs of Brodie L.
            Duke seated, one that perhaps shows a Duke tobacco barn, and three images showing him
            and Wylanta in front of a mock-up of Niagra Falls; likely created as souvernirs of their
            honeymoon. There is a radiograph x-ray of what seems to be Wylanta's dislocated or
            broken shoulder, resulting from her 1923 motor vehicle accident in France. The materials
            in the photographs series are organized by who or what they represent. All of the
            oversize photographs are contained in Box 5.</p>
