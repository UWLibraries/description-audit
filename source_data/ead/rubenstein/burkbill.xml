      <abstract id="aspace_ce1182d1a4b6d866f21d419c354b2820">"Bill" Burk, retired, botany librarian
        at the John N. Couch Biology Library, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Collection
        comprises three folders of letters written to Burk by botanist Sherwin Carlquist. The
        majority of the letters are accompanied by examples of Carlquist's black-and-white 8"x10"
        landscape photographs, including seven photographic prints on enlarging paper, as well as
        scanned copies printed on a laser printer. There are also advertisements for Carlquist's
        books of landscape photographs featuring male nudes. The letters are most often general
        holiday greetings Carlquist mailed to all his friends, usually annotated with specific notes
        to Burk; others are personal letters to Burk. Carlquist's letters mainly provide information
        regarding the accompanying photographs and his artistic approach to photography, especially
        the male nudes; there is additional commentary on the history of botany; his writing,
        publication, and research projects; the work of other scientists; and his personal life.
        Other topics include gay fiction and culture, the challenges of being gay in academe, and
        circumcision. Books mentioned include: HAWAII, OUTSIDERS, COMPARATIVE WOOD ANATOMY, TARWEEDS
        AND SILVERSWORDS, THE NATURAL MALE, MAN/NATURE, NATURAL MANSCAPES, MEN IN NATURE, UNCUT, and
        NATURAL OBJECTS.</abstract>
