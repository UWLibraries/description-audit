            Thompson Company (JWT) is one of the largest and oldest enduring advertising agencies in
            the United States. John F. Dignam was a commercial artist and an executive with JWT
            during a 26-year career, in which he held positions of Vice President and Senior Art
            Director. The John F. Dignam Papers cover the years 1958-2003, with the bulk of
            materials dating from the 1960s to 1987, roughly the period during which Dignam served
            as Art Director with the J. Walter Thompson (JWT) advertising agency. The collection
            primarily consists of advertising proofs and commercial artwork created for clients of
            JWT and other firms, including the Victor A. Bennett Company, along with some of
            Dignam's freelance work. The collection also includes a few reports, television
            commercial scripts and other writings, along with some videocassettes of television
            commercials. Companies represented in the collection include the Banco Popular de Puerto
            Rico, British Aerospace, British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), Ford Motor
            Company, the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, Harveys of Bristol, Jantzen, Pan AMerican
            World Airways, Inc., the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), Standard Brands, and the
            United States Aircraft Insurance Group (USAIG).</abstract>

         <p>The John F. Dignam Papers cover the years 1958-2003, with the bulk of materials dating
            from the 1960s to 1987, roughly the period during which Dignam served as Art Director
            with the J. Walter Thompson (JWT) advertising agency. The collection primarily consists
            of advertising proofs and commercial artwork created for clients of JWT and other firms,
            including the Victor A. Bennett Company, along with some of Dignam's freelance work. The
            collection also includes a few reports, television commercial scripts and other
            writings, along with some videocassettes of television commercials. Companies

         <p>Many of the advertisements and artwork arrived in envelopes and folders upon which
            Dignam had written notes concerning the backgrounds of many of the campaigns. The notes
            were photocopied and may be found included in the <emph render="bold">Business and
               Personal Files Series</emph> in a folder entitled <emph render="doublequote">Notes on

                           scenery, but the cars were being photographed at the same time, so I got
                           our studio in Detroit to make me a piece of art showing fall colors.
                           Also, the Aerodynamics: The Final Touch campaign with Jackie Stewart was
                           also done with artwork. You can't tell the photography from the

                           we should take as many liberties as possible. We bought film and borrowed
                           Ford cars from dealers, got people or family members to pose with them.
                           We presented the photos and hoped to sell the idea. Copy writer Warren
                           Weith and I were sent to Riverside, California to make an ad with the
                           winner. It rained so hard, and we couldn't stay over, so I went out in
                           the rain and shot every car, as they were stopped because of the rain. I
                           shot every one, so when we went back to New York, we found which car had
                           won approval. I had a photo of the car (in the rain), and we put together
                           an ad that eventually ran.</emph>]</p>

                     <p>[<emph render="italic">Dignam remarks: I did a campaign for Goodyear hoses,
                           featuring the Queen Mary, John Deere, and a power project in Texas. There
                           were 3-color dealer support ads, as well as a poster for belts and hoses.
                           Posters done by other companies usually featured sexy girls as a way to
                           attract attention; I thought a little girl and a dog would work just as
                           well, and it did! For the campaign for Omnifilm, the company wanted a
                           sports tie-in, so i worked something up with a photographer, Chuck
                           Lamonica. For a football scene, we rented a sky background; for tennis,
                           we rented a picture of a crowd; and for baseball, we just made a
                           background with a green fence. For Goodyear Aerospace, the company wanted
                           a simple and direct campaign. So this campaign, I made a profile of a
                           face and head, because all of the ideas that came out of Goodyear
                           Aerospace were of the mind! But for many years their ideas were all
                           secrets, as they marketed only to the U.S. goverment.</emph>

                           artists to refine. Clients asked why I didn't do finishes! Before I came
                           on board, the older campaigns were all on the comic side, with art
                           provided by Disney artists. I thought they should be more
                        classy.</emph>]</p>

                           at JWT sometime in the early 1980s, one of my studios, Agency Art, asked
                           me to lunch with Richard (Dick) McGreal. Dick was a Vice President at
                           USAIG. I was told Dick's Art Director had died and they wondered if I
                           could help him. I was working 25 hours a day and weekends on Ford, so I
                           couldn't help him. At the time, I had a Cessna 152, and that's why Agency
                           Art thought that we had things to talk about. Dick and I talked, and I
                           finally agreed to help him until he got a new Art Director. This
                           relationship lasted about 30 years. During that time, I designed their
                           stationery, letterheads, all ads, and posters. I got Ken Taylor of
                           Detroit--he paints cars for GMC, Ford, etc. ads. He's the best airbrush
                           artist I ever saw or worked with! I did all the Aviation News and
                           newsletters every month, also the Notes and Newsnotes. Also all brochures
                           of posters that hang in the offices of USAIG at 1 Seaport Plaza in New
                           York City. I got and went on all photo shoots, and at times I designed
                           all their posters. I also did some artwork for the National Business
                           Aircraft Association (NBAA), the Helicopter Association/International
                           (HAI), and NATA Safety. These folders contain some roughs by me, as well
                           as some color proofing by Ken and Susan Barret of Tucson, Arizona, and by
                           Dr. Mike Alper of Massachusetts. This type of proofing is no longer done
                           this way. I also did a large poster for USAIG's 75th anniversary, along
                           with a brochure that explains all the art in the poster.</emph>]</p>

                           first big account as Art Director. I was responsible for Harvey's wines,
                           which was owned by G.F. Heublein &amp; Bros. in Hartford, Connecticut.
                           The campaign sought to show how good wine was made. I didn't know much
                           about wines, and thought it would make an interesting story and visuals.
                           I was able to get Mitchell Hooks to do the artwork. Included is an
                           original piece of art by Hooks, and a few page and spread
                        ads.</emph>]</p>

                           Pan Am. The client wanted two people who had worked on Ford. I went to
                           England, France and Portugal to shoot the photos to be used in Pan Am
                           folders and posters, brochures, ads, etc. I took a very good
                           photographer, Bert Glinn, who shot for Life magazine, and we got a lot of
                           good photos in England. Bert's wife is a native of Broadway, and her
                           parents took care of the royal sheep farm, so we had great shots of the
                           countryside, and also in London. In France we photographed 4-star
                           restaurants as well as some exciting scenery. We also went to Portugal
                           where we got more good shots.</emph>]</p>
