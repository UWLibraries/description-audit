         <p>John Esten Cooke (1830-1886) was a novelist and farmer born in Winchester Virginia, one
            of 13 children, to John Rogers Cooke and Maria Pendleton Cooke. His literary career
            began in the 1840s, and be quickly became a successful and prolific novelist,
            journalist, poet, and short story writer. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1851, and then
            served the Confederate Army as a staff officer for J.E.B. Stuart during most of the war
            (Cooke was first cousin of Gen. Stuart's wife, Flora Cooke Stuart). He also served under
            Brig. Gen. Pendleton after Stuart's death in 1864, amd was promoted to major by the end
            of the war. He eventually published more than 30 novels and many articles and poems. He
            is most well-known for his biographies of J.E.B. Stuart and Stonewall Jackson, as well
            as his many historical novels set in Virginia. His Civil War diaries were published in
            1941 in the <title type="simple" render="italic">Journal of Southern History</title> by

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Professional and personal correspondence and literary notes of novelist and Civil War
            Confederate officer John Esten Cooke and of his brother, Philip Pendleton Cook
            (1816-1850), poet and storyteller. The John E. Cooke papers primarily consist of
            business letters from publishers and critical letters from literary friends during the
            1870s and 1880s, but also include letters from boyhood friends, a few Civil War letters.
            There are also diaries from the war period, and manuscript copies of Cooke's novel about
            Stonewall Jackson, <title type="simple" render="italic">Surry of Eagle's Nest</title>,
               <title type="simple" render="italic">A Legend of Turkey Buzzard Hollow</title>, and
            article <title type="simple" render="doublequote">On the Road to Despotism.</title> The
            Philip P. Cooke papers include letters to his father, of interest in themselves as
            literary productions; he was considered to be equally talented if not more so than his
            father. </p>
         <p>Civil War era items include a few letters written to Cooke, indicating his state of
            illness and discouragement during the war and his lack of communication with family; and
            Cooke's four manuscript diaries. The diaries contain references throughout to battles
            around Richmond, Cold Harbour, Chancellorsville, J.E.B. Stuart, Robert E. Lee, Gen. John
            R. Cooke, Stonewall Jackson (especially his death in 1863), Gen. William N. Pendleton,
            the re-election of Lincoln, camp life, and the social life of Stuart's staff. They also
            contain Cooke's literary jottings and references to literary figures such as Victor
            Hugo. A copy of the 1941 edition of the diaries is included in the collection.</p>
