        Infantry, U.S. Colored Troops. Collection consists of 21 personal letters of Alonzo Reed
        written while stationed in South Carolina during the latter part of the Civil War. Reed
        seems to have written some of the letters himself, while others were written for him by
        friends; all are addressed to his mother. He seems to have been in a camp in Detroit,
        Michigan, then was stationed in Hilton Head, S.C. in the summer of 1864; he remained there
        until 1865, when he was sent to Charleston, S.C., and then to Savannah, Georgia, and back to
        eastern S.C. for the duration. The letters indicate that Reed's regiment was often on picket
        duty, but also provide some descriptions of warfare and the ransacking of plantations. Reed,
        who was nearly illiterate, provides brief insights into daily camp life in terms of
        references of illnesses, hunger, not being paid for many months, and life as a soldier in
        the midst of war. Reed occasionally refers to the reception they received from both whites
        and blacks in the South. He also writes about fixing railroad supply lines and utilizing
        surrendered Confederate soldiers to aid in this work. In November 1864, he inquires as to
        whether African American men are being allowed to vote in the North and indicates that they
        are in the South. Arranged in chronological order.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection consists entirely of 21 personal letters from an African American Union soldier,
        Alonzo Reed, written to his mother while stationed in South Carolina during the latter part
        of the Civil War. Some of the letters were written by Reed, some by other individuals, and
        indicate that Reed's regiment was often on picket duty, though they also provide some
        descriptions of warfare and the ransacking of plantations during marches. A brief sketch of
        the letters is also included in the collection folder.</p>
      <p>Reed, who was nearly illiterate, provides brief insights into daily camp life in terms of
        references of illnesses, hunger, not being paid for many months, life as a soldier in the
        midst of war, and the desire to have news, photos, and writing supplies from home. Reed
        occasionally refers to the reception they received from both whites and blacks in the South.
        He also writes about fixing railroad supply lines and utilizing surrendered Confederate
        soldiers to aid in this work. In November 1864, he inquires as to whether African American
        men are being allowed to vote in the North and indicates that they are in the South.

          <p>Correspondence consists of 21 letters from Alonzo Reed to his mother both during and
            just after the U.S. Civil War. Also included within this collection is a brief
            descriptive sketch of unknown origin concerning Alonzo Reed and the collection. Several
            of the letters were written while Reed was stationed in Beaufort S.C., and they appear
            to pinpoint his location as Coosaw, S.C. (designated in the letters with variants such
            as Car Soil and Crew Saw).</p>
