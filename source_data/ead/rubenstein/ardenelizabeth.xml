      <abstract id="aspace_12e1f2d4c0d4ab985c2caa1889a3f86b">Elizabeth Arden was a pioneering
        cosmetics entrepreneur. In this letter, she writes to advise a potential customer on matters
        relating to health and beauty. Arden advises her to get plenty of rest, eat a balanced diet,
        and to use products from Arden's Venetian line in order to soothe her chapped hands. Arden
        writes, "I know that where one is a busy housewife and has many duties in a country home, it
        is hard to get rest and relaxation. Perhaps you are of the naturally alert, quick, nervous
        type and use up a lot of energy everyday."</abstract>

      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Elizabeth Arden, born Florence Nightingale Graham, was an innovative entrepreneur who was
        instrumental in the development of the modern cosmetics and beauty salon industry in both
        America and Europe. Her early 20th century marketing campaigns helped make cosmetics
        socially acceptable for use by American women for the first time. She was a proponent of
        proper diet and exercise as a way to preserve "youth and beauty." She supported women's
        suffrage, and provided red lipstick to symbolize women's independence for a large march in
        1912. In her spare time, she was successful in the male-dominated pursuit of race horse
        ownership.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The collection consists of a single autograph typescript letter dated 1926 June 26 written
        by Elizabeth Arden to a Mrs. Hyatt, who had contacted her for advice after hearing her speak
        on the radio. Arden writes, "I know that where one is a busy housewife and has many duties
        in a country home, it is hard to get rest and relaxation. Perhaps you are of the naturally
        alert, quick, nervous type and use up a lot of energy everyday." Arden advises her to "get a
        little rest period at least once a day and relax in a quiet room or take a soothing, warm
        bath and a little nap," as well as to eat a healthy diet. She goes on to recommend products
        in her Venetian Preparations line that will soothe chapped hands, and encloses her booklet
        "The Quest of the Beautiful." On letterhead stationery from 673 Fifth Avenue embossed with
        the Venetian trademark.</p>
