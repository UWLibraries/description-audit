        rising through the ranks to First Sergeant, he attended Officer Candidate School at Fort
        Benning, Georgia, and was commissioned as Second Lieutenant on November 21, 1942. From
        October 1944 to the end of 1945, he served in Italy with the 371st Infantry and participated
        in the campaigns of North Apennines and Po Valley. He was commissioned as First Lieutenant

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The collection includes awards, service records, scrapbook pages, and photographs that
        collectively document the military career and experiences of African American U.S. Army
        Lieutenant Earl G. Cunningham. The <emph render="bold">Scrapbook</emph> series contains more
        than 150 amateur photographs corner-mounted on 12 loose pages that were formerly part of a
        large scrapbook. The photographs, chiefly 2x3 inches, capture scenes in Allied-occupied
        Italy, often with Cunningham or his fellow African American soldiers in the foreground.
        Subjects include city streets, rural landscapes, coastal views, damaged buildings and
        destroyed tanks, mounds of rubble, Italian citizens, American soldiers, and partisan
        cemeteries. Brief, handwritten captions identify colleagues or locations including Pisa,
        Viareggio, Pietrasanta, Massa, Genoa, and Savona. The first few pages in the scrapbook
        include certificates of appointment demonstrating Cunningham's rise in the military from
        1941-1943, along with photographs taken at Camp Williams near Lehi, Utah before his service
        in Italy. </p>
      <p>The remainder of the collection is divided into the following series: <emph render="bold"
          >Military Awards</emph>, <emph render="bold">Military Records</emph>, and <emph
          render="bold">Photographs</emph>. Military awards and records include transcripts of
        service, discharge papers, a copy of Cunningham's marriage certificate from Maryland, and a
        Bronze Star medal. The loose photographs include his portrait and a series of
        black-and-white commercial photographic postcards from Genova and other cities in Italy,
        postmarked 1945, with one containing a message to his wife. </p>
      <p>Acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin Research Center for African and African American
        History and Culture.</p>
