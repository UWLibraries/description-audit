         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Frank Hunter was born in El Paso, Texas, and grew up in the desert Southwest. He has an
            M.A. in communications from the University of Colorado and an M.F.A. in photography from
            Ohio University, where he was the John Cady Graduate Fellow in Fine Art. Hunter has
            taught at the university level for more than twenty years. His interest in photographic
            processes includes the technical process of exposure and development as well as the
            psychological and spiritual aspects of creating photographic work. Hunter is best known
            for his landscape photographs done in the nineteenth-century process known as
            platinum/palladium. His recent work includes a commission done for the Federal Reserve
            Bank documenting Midtown Atlanta at the turn of the millennium, which was shown at the
            High Museum in Atlanta in 2003. His work is represented in a number of public and
            private collections, including the Speed Museum, the Denver Museum of Art, the High
            Museum, and the Houston Museum of Fine Arts. Hunter teaches at Duke University's Center
            for Documentary Studies.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection includes twenty 20x24 and fourteen 24x30 platinum photographs, and one
            DVD with electronic versions of the prints. The prints in this collection are from
            Hunter's exhibit, <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Still Point of the Turning
               World,</title> which was on display in 2010 in the Allen Building at Duke University.
            Prints include images of nature and its interactions with culture. Hunter made the
            photographs with an 8x10 view camera in Ohio, Kentucky, Georgia, North Carolina, South
            Carolina, and West Virginia. The DVD has been separated and migrated to Duke's
            electronic records server. Acquired as part of the Archive for Documentary Arts.</p>
         <p>The collection is sorted by the size of the images: there is one box with the 20x24
            photographs and one with the 24x30 photographs.</p>
