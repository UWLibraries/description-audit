        Collection consists of medical case files and casebooks, articles and papers,
        correspondence, photographs, ephemera, diplomas, and medical illustrations dating chiefly
        from the 1890s-1920s, relating to Dr. John Ridlon's career and extensive research and
        writings on orthopedics. Case files - a large majority of them pediatric - include
        tubercular infection of the joints, scoliosis and other deformities, spondylitis (spinal
        arthritis), and limb or joint injuries. There are hundreds of illustrations in the form of
        medical case photographs and photographic prints of early X-rays. Accompanying the papers is
        a set of 118 black-and-white photographs taken during Ridlon's medical military training at
        a base in Plattsburgh, N.Y., and some during his service as a surgeon in the U.S. Army
        Medical Corps during World War I. Duplicate and similar images are found in glass plate and
        nitrate film negatives. A set of 49 glass lantern slides of his time in the WWI medical camp
        were used to illustrate lectures about his experiences; a reprint of the lecture text is in
        the collection. There are also a handful of photographic portraits of Ridlon. Correspondents
        include: R. Osgood, A. Steindler, P.D. Wilson, R.K. Ghormley, J.E. Goldthwait, A.B. Judson,
        R.W. Lovett, H.W. Orr, S.W. Mitchell, and H. Cushing. In addition to discussing medical
        cases and research, letters also document Ridlon's involvement with two charitable
        institutions: the Home for Destitute Crippled Children (Chicago) and the Country Home for
        Convalescent Children. Acquired as part of the History of Medicine Collections at Duke
        University.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>This material, which documents John Ridlon's medical career, consists of medical case
        files, casebooks, articles and papers, correspondence, photographic materials, diplomas and
        ephemera, and medical illustrations, relating to Ridlon's research and writings on
        orthopedics. Case files - a large majority of them pediatric - include tubercular infection
        of the joints, scoliosis and other deformities, spondylitis (spinal arthritis), and limb or
        joint injuries. There are hundreds of medical illustrations in the form of photographs
        mounted on board, photographic prints of early X-rays, and printed illustrations on loose
        sheets that show patients, symptoms or deformities, and treatments such as surgery, braces
        and casts; many of them were used by Ridlon in his published works.</p>
      <p>Among the bound volumes are six casebooks (1889-1892); four letterbooks (1873-1903); an
        autograph manuscript, "Some comments on the principles and practice of Hugh Owen Thomas"
        (undated); a scrapbook of figures and illustrations (undated); three volumes composed of
        reprint clippings and manuscript notes (undated); and a bound volume of 88 reprints
        (1888-1923). There are also many diplomas and certificates received by Ridlon from various
        educational institutions.</p>
      <p>Correspondents include: R. Osgood, A. Steindler, P. D. Wilson, R. K. Ghormley, J. E.
        Goldthwait, A. B. Judson, R. W. Lovett, H. W. Orr, S. W. Mitchell, H. Cushing. In addition
        to discussing medical cases and research, letters also document Ridlon's involvement with
        two charitable institutions: the Home for Destitute Crippled Children (Chicago) and the
        Country Home for Convalescent Children.</p>
      <p>Accompanying the professional papers is a set of 118 black-and-white photographs taken
        during Ridlon's service as a surgeon in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World War I. The
        photos were taken by several photographers at a medico-military training camp in
        Plattsburgh, N.Y., around 1916. Ridlon reported on these experiences at a medical conference
        in 1917 and used a set of 67 glass lantern slides to illustrate the lecture, 49 of which
        survive in the collection; a reprint of this paper is also available in the collection. </p>
      <p>In the same series there is a set of 30 glass plate negatives and still image nitrate film
        negatives; these materials are closed to use but contain duplicate or similar images found
        in the print photographs. Finally, there are several portraits of Ridlon, chiefly
        photographs taken in his office and examination room, taken in 1911. A glass plate negative
        with a bust portrait of Ridlon rounds out the photographic series.</p>
      <p>The collection also contains several folders of ephemera, early professional diplomas and
        certificates, letters of recommendation for Ridlon's Chicago appointment in 1892, and his
        obituary.</p>
      <p>Acquired as part of the History of Medicine Collections at Duke University.</p>

          <p>Folders of case summaries maintained by Dr. Ridlon, most of them dating from 1900 to
            1915. At least half are pediatric cases. Cases include Pott's disease (tuberculosis of
            the spine), spondylitis, scoliosis (congenital and idiopathic), tubercular infection of
            the joints, other joint diseases and injuries, and congenital deformities. Case
            summaries are typically one to two pages long, and include patient names, ages,
            residence, family history, symptoms, measurements, treatment, and outcome. Occasionally
            other documents such as referral letters and records of tests such as urinalyses are

          <p>Contains 118 black-and-white photographs of the first medico-military training camp at
            Plattsburgh, N.Y. Images feature camp scenes, including camp cook stations, mules and
            wagons, a water truck, machine gun pits, headquarters tents, officers and privates, and
            drills and reviews of the infantry and cavalry. Several prints show Ridlon during litter
            drills. Names on the backs of certain groups of prints may indicate the photographers:
            Dr. Suches (?) and Dr. McGraw. Other individuals are also identified, and most of the
            images are captioned. </p>
          <p>Accompanying the photo prints is a set of 49 lantern slides Ridlon used for lectures
            bearing black-and-white photographs in excellent condition, along with the corresponding
            lecture text presented by John Ridlon at a conference in 1917, describing the camp and
            the American preparedness for war with respect to military medicine (photocopied from
            reprint #82 in the volume, <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Collected Papers of
              Dr. John Ridlon</title>, also in this collection). The paper was originally
            illustrated by 67 lantern slides. Also in this series are 30 glass plate negatives and
            eight nitrate film negatives which, like the lantern slides, contain duplicate images
            found in the photographic prints folders.</p>
          <p>Series also includes three postcards from the camp at Plattsburgh, three photographic
            portraits of John Ridlon, two prints of him seated at a desk in his office, and two of
            him in his examination room, one of which is a duplicate; a wall calendar gives the date
            as 1911. A glass plate negative bearing a bust portrait of Ridlon rounds out the
            series.</p>

            <p>These documents date from Ridlon's earliest professional years, before his
              appointment to the Chicago Medical School. As the letters and diplomas document,
              Ridlon matriculated from Tufts College, and went on to serve in New York City at the
              New York Orthopaedic Dispensary and Hospital, St. Luke's Hospital, and Vanderbilt
              Clinic; he also served at Bellevue Hospital as attending surgeon of the Orthopedic
              Division (outpatient) from 1887-1889.</p>
