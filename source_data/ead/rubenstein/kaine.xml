         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Alice J. Cutright was born in Chillicothe, Ohio, on January 29, 1845. The Cutright
            family moved to Springfield, Ill., in 1852 where Ms. Cutright attended school and
            eventually began to teach public school. In 1869 she married Dr. John L. Kaine, a
            journalist from Milwaukee, Wis., and in 1874 the Kaines moved to Milwaukee where Dr.
            Kaine took a position with the <title type="simple" render="italic">Milwaukee
               Sentinel</title> and Alice Kaine continued her work in education and public
            service.</p>
         <p>Ms. Kaine was an active member on the Board of the Wisconsin Industrial School for Girls
            on which she served for 27 years, fourteen of those as Secretary. From 1894-1896 she was
            employed as an advisor to Tuskegee Institute and in 1898 she became the first woman
            appointed to serve on the Wisconsin State Board of Control for Prisons. Kaine was active
            in several social and civic clubs such as the Women's Club of Wisconsin and the Social
            Economics Club. She was a charter member of the Milwaukee Chapter of the Daughters of
            the American Revolution. In 1933, she was admitted to the Grand Army Home where she died
            in 1947.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The papers of Alice J. Cutright Kaine document her work primarily as an administrative
            advisor at the Tuskegee Institute but also include information on her employment as a
            public school teacher in Springfield, Ill., her service on the board of the Wisconsin
            Industrial School for Girls and the State Board of Control (for prisons), and her
            travels to Dixfield, Maine, and Nelson County, Va. The collection contains
            correspondence, writings, legal papers, printed materials, photographs, and
            ephemera.</p>
         <p>The strength of the collection lies with its documentation of Tuskegee Institute. Kaine
            was hired in 1894 as the head of the Household Department to supervise everything "from
            the making of bricks to the baking of white bread." (newsclipping, 1947) At the time,
            Kaine was the only white person on the Institute's staff.</p>
         <p>Letters to her brother, Austin Cutright, describe her work her at Tuskegee Institute as
            well as the Tuskegee community in general. In these letters she speaks frankly about
            Booker T. Washington's educational philosophy and management style and her close
            relationship with Washington's wife Margaret and their children. Kaine visited several
            black families and churches in Tuskegee with the Washingtons and her letters and
            writings describe the living conditions and religious services she observed as well as
            the difficulties she had as a white woman in an all black community.</p>
         <p>Approximately half of the correspondence from 1896-1903 consists of letters written to
            Kaine from Tuskegee administrators and Margaret Washington after Kaine's departure from
            Tuskegee. Letters from J.H. Washington, Superintendent of Industries, contain
            information on the maintenance of housekeeping practices established by Kaine. Letters
            from Margaret Washington are of a more personal nature and contain anecdotes and news
            from Tuskegee. Several of the writings and speeches concern Kaine's work at Tuskegee and
            describe her experiences from a sympathetic yet somewhat patronizing point of view. A
            file of printed materials relates exclusively to Tuskegee Institute, and a portrait of
            the Washington family (ca. 1895) is filed in the photographs series.</p>
         <p>Outside of the materials relating to Tuskegee Institute, the papers provide only
            fragmented documentation of Kaine's life. A few letters to Kaine in the 1860s and 1870s
            describe her appointment to various teaching positions. Legal papers, writings and
            addresses, and newsclippings reflect her work with the Wisconsin Industrial School for
            Girls, the State Board of Control, and various social and civic organizations.</p>
         <p>Earlier letters, chiefly written to her husband, depict Kaine's visits in the 1880s to
            New England, particularly Dixfield, Maine, and to her ancestral home in Nelson County,
            Va. Letters from Dixfield describe the local community life in detail. The series of
            photographs contains several views of Lovingston, Va., including churches, the
            courthouse, a hotel, Negro houses and other homes. Letters to Kaine from her brother
            during the 1940s detail his life in Milwaukee during World War II and to some extent
            Kaine's life at the Grand Army Home until her death.</p>
