      <abstract id="aspace_8f06ffa08ae2a45fe27b98e734fe3e01">Maynard Miller was an African American
        Staff Sergeant with the 3540th and 3524th Quartermaster Truck Company, an African American
        company stationed in occupied Japan in 1946. Collection consists of a large photograph
        album, marked "property of Staff Sergeant Maynard Miller," containing approximately 200
        photographs of African American soldiers in Tokyo and other locales in occupied Japan during
        1946. Most of the photographs include captions with identification, nicknames, and
        commentary, including G.I. humor. Several photographs depict African American soldiers with
        Japanese girlfriends. Other images depict Army living quarters and equipment, clubs,
        Hirohito's palace, zoo animals, crowds on Japanese election day, and tourist destinations in
        and around Tokyo. Also included in the back of the album are carbon copies of two vividly
        eloquent typewritten letters complaining of discrimination -- one about Senator Bilbo and
        "the Negro problem" in Mississippi (1 p.) and another addressed to the Commanding General,
        Eighth Army, complaining of discriminatory practices barring African American soldiers from
        using the swimming pool (3 pp.). Acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin Research Center
        for African and African American History and Culture.</abstract>
