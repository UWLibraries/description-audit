      <abstract id="aspace_cb22803a6b4b0db9f7c5b9c7708eec6a">Mary Rudge was a peace activist and
        poet. Collection comprises an unpublished typescript Share the Seed: A Farmworkers
        Anthology, containing a compilation of voices of the Farmworkers Movement, edited by Mary
        Rudge, dated 1979. There are at least one hundred items, including narratives and
        interviews, poems, songs, documents, sketches, and photocopied photographs, focusing on
        farmworkers in California, as well as elsewhere in the United States. The text features
        corrections and emendations. Signed by Rudge at the end of her foreword to the volume.
        Velobound in brown vinyl covers. Several pages missed the binding and are thus laid in. Also
        laid in are several ephemeral pieces from the farmworkers movement.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection comprises an unpublished typescript Share the Seed: A Farmworkers Anthology,
        containing a compilation of voices of the Farmworkers Movement, edited by Mary Rudge, dated
        1979. There are at least one hundred items, including narratives and interviews, poems,
        songs, documents, sketches, and photocopied photographs, focusing on farmworkers in
        California, as well as elsewhere in the United States. The text features corrections and
        emendations. Signed by Rudge at the end of her foreword to the volume. Velobound in brown
        vinyl covers. Several pages missed the binding and are thus laid in. Also laid in are
        several ephemeral pieces from the farmworkers movement: a printed Thanksgiving letter from
        Cesar Chavez, 1969, commemorating the fifth Thanksgiving of the farm workers' struggle; El
        Malcriado, "The Voice of the Farm Worker" newsletter for November and December, 1969; The
        Picket Line newsletter, July 18, 1975; and a one-page legal-size handbill promoting an
        [1969] event sponsored by the UFWOC (United Farm Workers Organizing Committee) Defense Fund
        Committee.</p>
