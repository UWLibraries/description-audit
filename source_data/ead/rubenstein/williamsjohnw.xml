         <abstract id="aspace_81b20959a4e7652d4c4dc5f63e89787a">John W. Williams was a Philadelphia
            lawyer. A small collection of legal papers, correspondence, and clippings chiefly
            concerning an 1835 lawsuit in which Robert Aitken of Baltimore alleged that a mulatto
            girl living in Philadelphia was Emily Winder, the daughter of Milly Winder. Milly Winder
            was Aitken's former slave whom he had freed in 1824, while keeping her daughter as his
            slave. Aitken claimed that the child had been stolen from him and given to Jacob Gilmore
            and his wife, free African Americans, to raise as their child. John W. Williams handled
            Aitken's suit for the girl's return. Includes affidavits, subpoenas, and notes on the
            testimonies of both black and white witnesses for the defense and the prosecution,
            including the testimony of Milly Winder, who told of her attempts to locate her daughter
            after she was freed.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Samll collection of legal papers, correspondence, and clippings chiefly concerning an
            1835 lawsuit in which Robert Aitken of Baltimore alleged that a mulatto girl living in
            Philadelphia was Emily Winder, the daughter of Milly Winder. Milly Winder was Aitken's
            former slave whom he had freed in 1824, keeping her daughter as his slave. Aitken
            claimed that the child had been stolen from him ten years earlier and given to Jacob
            Gilmore and his wife, free African Americans, to raise as their child. Gilmore claimed
            that the defendant could not be the slave Aitken was searching for, in that he claimed
            that a woman gave the girl to him and his wife several years before Aitken's slave went
            missing.</p>
         <p>Papers include the notes and evidence compiled by John W. Williams, the lawyer for the
            plaintiff Aitken, to present the case before the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. The
            lawyer for the defense was David Paul Brown. Witnesses for the defense claim to have
            known Emily as a little girl in Philadelphia prior to 1825, and believed her to be
            white, while witnesses for the prosecution claimed Emily was Aitken's missing slave.
            Includes the testimony of Milly Winder, who told of her attempts to locate her daughter
            after she was freed and who claimed that the woman in question could not be her daughter
            that went missing. This case occurred before the passing of the Federal Fugitive Slave
            Act of 1850, which removed the possibility of a court trial prior to the removal of an
            alleged fugitive slave.</p>
