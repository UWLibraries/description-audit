         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Edwin Peacock Papers span the dates 1915 to 1997, with the majority of the items
            dating from the 1940s to 1997, and provide many insights into the life and work of
            Carson McCullers through materials in three series: Correspondence, Photographs, and
            Printed Materials. The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph>, largest in the
            collection, is comprised primarily of letters to Edwin Peacock and John Zeigler. Many
            are from translators and biographers of McCullers (Virginia Carr, Jacques Tournier, and
            Robert Duparc). There is also significant correspondence by the author's husband, Reeves
            McCullers, and copies of letters to each other while Reeves served in the armed forces
            in France during World War II.</p>
         <p>The bulk of the <emph render="bold">Photographs Series</emph> consists of black and
            white snapshots primarily from the 1940s and 1950s. The majority of them represent
            Carson McCullers, her friends and family, including Edwin Peacock, John Zeigler, Mary
            Mercer, her sister, and her mother.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Printed Materials and Clippings Series</emph> consists of
            documents related to the work of Carson McCullers. Formats include playbills, critical
            articles, reviews, and clippings. There is also a high-school essay on McCullers by the
            niece of John Zeigler, and materials related to various conferences and symposiums about
            the author.</p>

         <head>Related Material</head>
         <p>Related materials include the Carson McCullers Papers, the Virginia Spencer Carr Papers,
            the Mary E. Mercer Collection of Carson McCullers-Mary Tucker Correspondence, and the
            Mary Sames Tucker Papers, all housed at Duke University's David M. Rubenstein Rare Book
            &amp; Manuscript Library. Duke also houses the papers of John Zeigler, Peacock's friend
            and bookstore co-owner.</p>
         <p>In addition, the Edwin Peacock Papers previously contained letters from Dawn Langley
            Simmons, who was a friend of Peacock and Zeigler, as well as photographs and printed
            materials relating to Simmons and McCullers. At the request of both donors, the Simmons
            material was transferred to the Dawn Pepita Langley Hall Simmons Papers held by the
            David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library at Duke University. Please see

               <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
               <p>The bulk of the series consists of correspondence written to the bookstore owners
                  Edwin Peacock and John Zeigler, although there are a few letters addressed to
                  Zeigler's neighbor, Robert Holmes. Prominent correspondents are Carson McCullers
                  and her husband Reeves, who wrote to each other nearly every day while Reeves
                  served in the army during World War II. There is also significant correspondence
                  from the biographers of McCullers, especially Virginia Carr, as well as Jacques
                  Tournier and Robert Duparc. Other correspondence includes letters McCullers wrote
                  to Peacock during her stay at Yadoo, letters from Reeves's friend, John Vincent
                  Adams, and letters from the sister of McCullers, Margarita Smith. Topics relate
                  primarily to McCullers's work and to personal matters. Folders in the series are
                  arranged alphabetically; items within folders are in chronological order.</p>

               <p>Contains 62 photographs (7 color, 55 black and white), one negative and two
                  postcards. Several photographs come from the mid-1930s, but the bulk is from the
                  late 1940s, after Reeves returned from the war, and from the McCullers' stay in
                  Bachivillers, France during the early 1950s. There are also some snapshots from
                  the 1960s. Apart from McCullers herself, the people represented are primarily
                  family members (her mother and sister) and friends, including Mary Mercer, Edwin
                  Peacock, John Zeigler, and the Italian writer Alberto Moravia. The series is
                  arranged in roughly chronological order, accompanied by a partial itemized
                  inventory.</p>

               <p>The materials in this series relate primarily to the work of Carson McCullers, and
                  include playbills, critical articles, and reviews of her books and plays.
                  Particularly well documented is <title type="simple" render="italic">The Member of
                     the Wedding</title>. There are also a few ephemeral items, including newspaper
                  clippings, obituaries, a high-school essay on McCullers written by John Zeigler's
                  niece, and information about various conferences and symposiums about the writer.
                  Folders are arranged alphabetically; items within are arranged in chronological
                  order.</p>
