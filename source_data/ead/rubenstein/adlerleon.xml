      <p>Leon S. Adler was the son of Marcus Mordechai Valentine Adler and Jeanette B Sternberger
        and was born in Lebanon, Ind., in 1912. He married Roslyn Woolf, known to the family as
        "Posy," in 1937; the couple had two children. He was a successful manager of retail clothing
        stores. Adler became a Lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Reserves during World War II, eventually
        serving as a Communications and Public Information officer from Feb. 1945-Dec. 1945 aboard
        the U.S.S. Biloxi. He was among the first U.S. occupation forces that arrived in Hiroshima
        and Nagasaki following the dropping of the atomic bombs, and his photographic and written
        documentation was uncensored.</p>

          <p>One photograph album is entitled "Nagasaki: City of the Dead" in a calligraphic hand,
            and focuses on Adler's tour of the city one month after the United States dropped the
            atomic bomb, 1945 September 18-24. On 20 pages, there are 61 black-and-white 3x5-inch
            photographs of his tour, documenting the destruction, buildings still standing, medical
            treatment areas, returned prisoners of war ("ramps"), and conditions for residents
            remaining. Includes an hand-written introduction, and all photographs are fully
            captioned in ink. The album also contains a map of Nagasaki and a undated certificate of
            recognition signed by President George H. W. Bush following Adler's death in 1990
            (mentioned in the records file, likely added much later).</p>

          <p>A second photograph album has a leather cover stamped with the U.S.S. Biloxi banner and
            Adler's name. This album (133 pages, 351 black-and-white photographs and snapshots,
            sizes from 2.5x4-inches to 8x10-inches) comprehensively documents life aboard the ship,
            during leisure and training periods, along with their assignments in Okinawa, Nagasaki,
            and Hiroshima. Some photographs duplicate those in the Nagasaki photograph album. Most
            photographs are accompanied by typed captions.</p>

          <p>The scrapbook maintained by Posy Adler (1943-1945) contains naval service forms,
            letters, informational documents, certificates, and newsletters and publications, along
            with a few family letters and letters from business connections regarding Leon's
            commission, greeting cards and postcards, mementos and newspaper clippings, and twenty
            two black-and-white photographs. However, the primary focus of the scrapbook was to hold
            Leon's telegrams and over 183 letters he wrote to Posy during his service. Leon wrote
            weekly, sometimes daily, and the letters provide a complete description of his service,
            including training, leisure activities, excursions, homesickness, and other experiences.
            They often also touch on Adler Company business matters, and his pride in his wife's
            operation of the store during his absence. Once Leon joined the crew of the Biloxi, his
            letters focused on life aboard ship, his duties, description of ports, family matters,
            then the end of the war, the dropping of the atomic bombs, and his preparations to leave
            the navy.</p>
