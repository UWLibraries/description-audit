      <p>Hippolyte Arnoux (active ca. 1860 - ca. 1890) was a French photographer and publisher.
        During the 1860s, he documented the excavation of the Suez Canal and published the resulting
        photographs. At the same time, he occasionally worked with the Port Said photographic
        studio, Adelphoi Zangaki. In the late 1860s, Arnoux was a partner of Antonio Beato.</p>
