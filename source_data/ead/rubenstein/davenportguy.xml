         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Box 1 of the collection contains a few letters from Davenport, primarily written to
            Dorothy E. Roberts, a secretary in Duke University's English Department. There are
            clippings regarding his his career and family, along with book reviews written by him or
            about his work. Also includes collected contributions to a symposium (1974) on
            Davenport's work printed in the serial <title type="simple" render="italic"
               >Margins</title>. Included are the author's short stories "A Gingham Dress,"
            "Belinda's World Tour," and "Juno of the Veii," as well as his article "The Symbol of
            the Archiaic."</p>
         <p>Box 2 of the collection contains letters and postcards from Davenport to Abbott (Tom)
            Gleason. There are 68 pieces of correspondence, with all but three from 1960-1962;
            others are from 1963, 1964, 1966, and one undated. Totals include 37 letters (20 ALS and
            17 TLS); 30 postcards; one holiday card. The 37 letters amount to 71 pages, plus 31
            postcards and a card, equals 102 "pages" of text, mostly concentrated in three years.
            Three letters are on airmail stationary; from the lot there are only two absent
            envelopes. </p>
         <p>The correspondence discusses both parties' personal and intellectual lives. Davenport
            confesses his attraction for Gleason and his struggle with Gleason's lack of
            reciprocation. Davenport asserts, however, his ability to refrain from acting on his
            attraction. Many of the letters recount daily life, some in a very lyrical and detailed
            manner, while other letters raise general intellectual inquiry on subjects such as art,
            photography, quotations, etc. Discussion passes about the works and progress of
            Davenport's contemporaries, including prominent writers such as Ezra Pound and Samuel
            Beckett. Postcards and other letters document travel.</p>
