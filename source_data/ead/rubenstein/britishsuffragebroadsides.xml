        and handbills from British women's suffrage societies, primarily the National Union of
        Women's Suffrage Societies, but including the Conservative and Unionist Women's Franchise
        Association and the London Society for Women's Suffrage, as well as one handbill from the
        Cambridge Daily News. Two broadsides announce suffragist marches, including one in support
        of women's military service during World War I. Several handbills provide general
        information on women's suffrage and suffrage societies, others are intended for specific
        audiences, including working and affluent women. Other topics include protests against use
        of violence in the suffragist cause, the Conciliation Bill for Women's Suffrage, and
        positions of various elected officials on the issue. The back of one broadside holds a
        handwritten excerpt from an unrelated drama.</abstract>
