      <p>The Workers' Defense League was an American socialist organization devoted to promoting
        labor rights. The group was founded on August 29, 1936 with the endorsement of Norman
        Thomas, a six-time presidential candidate of the Socialist Party of America. The WDL
        described itself as a "militant, politically nonpartisan organization which would devote
        itself exclusively to the protection of workers' rights." Its officers included Thomas,
        David Clendenin, George S. Counts, and Pauli Murray.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection comprises material mailed by the Workers' Defense League primarily as part of
        fundraising efforts, particularly on the part of legal cases undertaken by the organization.
        The main case was that of Odell Waller, a Virginia sharecropper sentenced to death in 1940
        for killing his white landlord. Arguing that the landlord had cheated Waller and that he had
        in any case acted in self-defense, the WDL raised money for Waller's defense, lobbied for
        the commutation of his sentence, and mounted a nationwide publicity campaign on his behalf.
        The effort was unsuccessful, and Waller was executed on July 2, 1942. Other cases included
        Alton Levey, Rosario Chirillo, and Tee Davis; the organization worked in support of federal
        regulation to repeal poll taxes. Items include brochures on the Waller case, luncheon and
        dinner invitations, a tear sheet for an advertisement, action alerts, flyer announcing a
        contest and a mass meeting in New York, and contribution forms with mailing envelopes.</p>
      <p>Also includes a fundraising mailer (1946 May 16) related to Tee Davis and sent by Lillian
        Smith, the author of the novel STRANGE FRUIT. Tee Davis was an African American from
        Arkansas who was sentenced to ten years in prison for assault with intent to kill. His crime
        was firing a shotgun towards the bottom of the front door to his home while an intruder
        tried to break in. The intruder was a white sheriff looking for thieves.</p>
