      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Chiefly incoming correspondence to George M. Brown, doctor and farmer in Cumberland County,
        Virginia. Correspondence spans the period before, during and after the Civil War. Also
        includes personal writings of Brown spanning the same time period. </p>
      <p>The topics discussed include slavery, the price of slaves, price of commodities, and
        thoughts on events leading up to the war. Three letters seek his medical opinion regarding
        slaves that had been sold. One letter, dated June 19, 1858 requests a deposition regarding
        the health of a slave, Charles, sold by Robert Livingston. Two letters, dated June 29 and
        July 3, 1860 discuss a slave Eliza, who was sold in January 1859 to a cotton farmer in
        Mississippi, and her pregnancy, life and health prior to and after this sale. Another
        letter, from his brother L.C. Brown, dated October 31, 1863, discusses the falling price of
        slaves following the Emancipation Proclamation. </p>
      <p>A series of letters from Joseph F. Lewis, who worked for the Confederate Post Office
        Department in Richmond, begin in October, 1863. Many letters contain requests for specific
        food items and other goods to be sent.</p>
      <p>Some letters concerning Conway Brown from 1860-1878 contain information on the treatment of
        tuberculosis. </p>
      <p>Some of the post-war letters deal with potential properties for purchase in Florida, Texas,
        and Mexico. </p>
      <p>Many of Brown's own writings are in the form of letters to editors, many addressed to a
        newspaper, "The Whig." The letters convey a pro-slavery and anti-abolition stance. One
        letter, addressed to Genl. U.S. Grant and dated July 4, 1869, conveys the opinion "that the
        negro is constitutionally and innately averse to regular labor."</p>
