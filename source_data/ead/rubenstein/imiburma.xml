      <abstract id="aspace_078677b385bd61a2eb26972e36f2cbaa">The non-profit agency International
        Monitor Institute (IMI) operated between 1993 and 2003, primarily to assist international
        war-crimes tribunals by collecting, indexing and organizing visual evidence of violations of
        international human rights law. The International Monitor Institute Records, Burma
        Videotapes span the dates 1992-2002, and comprise audiovisual materials related to IMI's
        documentation of contemporary conflicts and human rights violations in Burma (Myanmar).
        These audiovisual records largely document the activities, interviews, speeches, press
        conferences and ceremonies of political figures, especially Aung San Suu Kyi, and document
        the activities of political and military institutions such figures represent, including the
        All Burma Students Democratic Front (ABSDF), the National League for Democracy (NLD) and the
        State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). Records also include extensive network and
        independent story packages of Burma and footage of human rights conflicts. Topics and
        footage cover life in Burma under military regime, refugees and refugee camps (especially
        Karen refugees), political prisoners, survivor stories, forced labor, Japan's role in the
        refugee situation, and Los Angeles protests against the SLORC and Unocal. These records
        include copies of approximately 268 video cassettes. The video and audio material is indexed
        by an extensive database developed by IMI which includes keywords, air dates, segment
        producer, and segment title. Acquired as part of the Human Rights Archive. Further
        organizational material on Burma can be found in the International Monitor Institute
        Records, also at the Rubenstein Library.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical Note for Pippa Scott</head>
      <p>The International Monitor Institute (IMI) was founded in 1993 by actress and film producer
        Pippa Scott. Scott, daughter of screenwriter Allan Scott who wrote some of the
        Astaire-Rogers films, was educated in California and in England, at Radcliffe College and
        the Southern California Institute of Architecture. Ms. Scott acted in such films as "The
        Searchers" and "Auntie Mame," and was a founding partner of the Emmy-award winning
        television company Lorimar Productions (producer of such TV hits as "The Waltons" and
        "Dallas" ). Scott established Linden Productions in 1987 to develop documentaries focusing
        on current issues. Linden's latest production is "King Leopold's Ghost," a documentary about
        the exploitation of the Congo by King Leopold II of Belgium. Scott was a member of the
        Women's Refugee Commission, the Pacific Council on Foreign Relations, and the Los Angeles
        World Affairs Council.</p>

      <head>Historical Note for the International Monitor Institute</head>
      <p>Organizational History. The International Monitor Institute was founded in 1993 and
        operated until 2003. Its primary mission was to assist international war-crimes tribunals by
        collecting, indexing and organizing visual evidence of violations of international human
        rights law. Videos and audio tapes were acquired through donation as well as on collecting
        trips by IMI associates in the former Yugoslavia, Kuwait, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Iraq, Burma
        (Myanmar), Thailand, Cambodia, and other countries. IMI's activities also included
        developing regional archives of videos on conflict and human rights abuses, producing film
        and multimedia projects to assist humanitarian organizations, organizing public outreach
        events, conducting video research for governments, film makers, authors, and students, and
        providing educational outreach. Patrons and partners of IMI and its collections included the
        International Criminal Court and its staff, Human Rights Watch, Physicians for Human Rights,
        the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the governments of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, and former
        First Lady Hillary Clinton.</p>

                (English).</item>
              <item>This video portrays a general picture of Burma's struggle for democracy and the
                Junta's human right abuses, and includes interviews with refugees, deserters and
                soldiers from the student army and an exiled student named Htin Aung.</item>
              <item>Behind the peaceful landscape and holiness of the pagodas, we see evidence of
                the torture of Burmese people. The people's demand for democratic changes in 1988
                resulted in thousands of deaths.Thousands of students fled Burma in order to plan a
                coup against the regime.</item>
              <item>In 1992 reporters visited Manawplaw HQ of Karen National Union on the Thai
                border. The student army, All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF), joined
                them.</item>
              <item>Htin Aung was from a family of 10. His brothers and sisters were scattered and
                jailed.He could not attend the funerals of either of his parents.</item>
              <item>Htin Aung fled Burma with his family and left his little sister behind with
                villagers and never saw her again.</item>
              <item>Chatate's parents were killed by the army. He ran away and ended up joining
                ABSDF. He said, "I am not scared. I am holding a gun not a stick...."</item>
              <item>Kevin, an American living in Manawplaw said, "Nonviolent? After your father was
                taken as porter and your mother was raped and you were forced to watch? What can you
                expect?"</item>
              <item>In 1994 Htin Aung married San San Aye and had twin daughters. "As long as Burma
                is not free," he said, "we won't go back.We will stay here. We will fight if not in
                our generation then my daughters will carry on."</item>
              <item>An interview was conducted with two deserters from the State Law and Order
                Restoration Council (SLORC) who talked about abuses to porters.</item>
              <item>In January 1995 Manawplaw fell. Htin Aung was in the jungle at the time and his
                two daughters were hit by malaria.</item>
              <item>A reporter in Rangoon met San's parents with Aung San Suu Kyi.</item>
              <item>The National League for Democracy's (NLD) stand on ABSDF is as follows:
                "Unfortunately we can't stop them from taking up arms because we can't guarantee
                their safety here."</item>
              <item>During Christmas 1995, Htin Aungwas in Bangkok. In 1996, he left for Australia
                where he stayed in the Refugee Processing Camp for a year.</item>
              <item>At the end of the interview with one student and Myint Myint San about torture
                in prison, Htin Aung said: "My country will win finally." The reporter remarked,
                "The picture records the moment of truth before they are changed."</item>

              <item>Interview Episode 1:</item>
              <item>In August 1997, Aung San Suu Kyi discussed various economic and political issues
                taking place in Burma and the National League for Democracy (NLD): "Investment in
                Burma won't be a success due to instability and inflation. Dialogue is the best
                possible solution to the problems in Burma." She expressed the NLD's readiness for
                comprehensive dialogue with the government, not merely a meeting. Although Suu Kyi's
                movements were restricted and her speeches were not reaching the public,people could
                get the updates through Radio Free Asia, BBC, VOA or theDemocratic Voice of Burma.
                Regarding the political stalemate, Suu Kyi said, "Politics is not a drama, it is
                everyone's life.The regime-sponsored National convention will not bring genuine
                democracy because their members do not truly represent the people." When generals
                accused her of being a dictator in NLD, she said generals did not understand
                democracy.</item>
              <item>Interview Episode 2.</item>
              <item>November 1996: Burmese citizens do not have the right to file a complaint when
                they are deprived of political rights by the government. Although the State Law and
                Order Restoration Council (SLORC) signed the United Nations Convention on Child
                Abuse,they did not prevent children from working in government projects. SLORC must
                deliver basic family rights before it can go further.(Continue interview in Tape

              <item>"If one is forced to workagainsthis will, it is forced labor no matter how noble
                the project may be. Labor culture thrives in Burma."</item>
              <item>In June 1996, 4 points people's desire was very paranoid. The State Law and
                Order Restoration Council Council (SLORC)-sponsored anti NLD marches were not
                evidence of NLD's failure. People are forced to attend those rallies. General Kyaw
                Ba was mentioned threatening Suu Kyi on the dialogue issues. When Lee Kuan Yew
                commented that SLORC should be in power to prevent what had happened in Bosnia from
                happening in Burma, Suu Kyi said Bosnia's problem was not caused by a weak
                government but rather by a strong government's prolonged oppression.</item>
              <item>In November 1996, a riot scene from Rangoon right after Suu Kyi's car was
                attacked by around 200 members of the Union Solidarity Development Association
                (USDA); SLORC sponsored the youth wing members. Suu Kyi and the other executive
                committee members were seen persuading people not to retaliate but to go home
                safely.</item>

              <item>The State Law and Order Restoration Council's (SLORC) open market economy does
                not benefit the majority. It only benefits the elite.The system is not a genuine
                market economy but "crony capitalism." The sanctions will not benefit the vast
                majority who are not also beneficiaries of market economy. The SLORC does not spend
                on public health, education and other development programs at all. Sanctions will
                force the bankrupt SLORC to the dialogue table with the National League for
                Democracy (NLD). The timing of this will be when there is a confirmed repression
                being committed by the SLORC against citizens and an opposition such as the mass
                arrest of NLD members and a physical attack on NLD members by the Union Solidarity
                and Development Association (USDA). Suu Kyi expressed that NLD's will is free, free

              <item>Brief Scene of Aung San Suu Kyi's compound and the NLD Headquarters.</item>
              <item>Interview with Aung San Suu Kyi, October 2,1996.</item>
              <item>Press conference: May 1996, Suu Kyi announced that 195 elected representatives,
                10 ordinary members and 12 from the youth wings were arrested so far by the State
                Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) in an attempt to obstruct the NLD
                congress. All ECs are still free. NLD intends to go ahead as planned. SLORC claimed
                that NLD did not enjoy popular support. Suu Kyi countered that SLORC spent a great
                deal ofenergy to arrest and disrupt NLD congress which is much smaller than a SLORC
                wedding; proof that SLORC is nervous. Sanctions won't hurt great the majority of
                Burmese. Investments benefit only a small fraction of population closed to SLORC who
                are already wealthy. Suu Kyi joked about taking military intelligence's (MI)
                pictures and publishing them.</item>
              <item>Press Conference: NLD is always ready for dialogue. NLD will lead Burma toward
                democracy as soon as possible. Suu Kyi claimed that 1996 was the critical year for
                Burma's democracy. Investments can't be stopped but no profit is expected. In Burma
                there is no rule of law and the economy is in bad shape. It was not known how much
                the Japanese government had provided in humanitarian aid to Burma. Arrests and
                harassments have proven that SLORC is nervous about NLD. Suu Kyi was released but
                not free. SLORC would be happy if she leaves Burma. More arrests including Suu Kyi's
                arrest was anticipated. SLROC has broken promises.</item>
              <item>Suu Kyi walked while newsmen followed. She mentioned U Win Htein's arrest and
                the emotional matter.</item>
              <item>Interviews after the Congress were canceled due to road blocks in October 1996.
                Suu Kyi announced that a total of over 500 were detained. All those efforts were
                wasted due to lack of dialogue. When asked if the Burmese see no hope and no sign of
                change, she said people had no choice except to hope and wait and work. But people
                will never give up on peace and justice. She never breaks promises. SLORC gives out
                false information on her and NLD. SLORC does not allow her to go on out of town
                trips. SLORC persuades Asian diplomats not to invite her.Phone calls are
                intercepted. Her security is SLORC's excuse but is actually more for digging
                information. (Continued on tape 7)</item>

              <item>Two people interviewed by ABC, U Win Htein &amp; Eva (Maung San Hlaing) were
                arrested as part of the State Law and Order Restoration Council's (SLORC)
                intimidation campaign. Suu Kyi and some National League for Democracy (NLD) members
                will continue to work. They know the consequences of doing so. NLD as a political
                party has to function as it is supposed to.</item>
              <item>Chicago Herald Tribune's Burmese article was cut out with scissors. U Aye Win,
                Suu Kyi's assistant, was nowhere to be found. Some members were released. Final
                statistics showed over 800 were arrested nationwide. Only 20 to 30 had been charged
                and only 23 released. Suu Kyi said, "Too much blood has been spilled, that many have
                been put into jail. People have tried. What more could we do? Bloodshed before
                change is a wrong concept. We don't believe in violence." End Interview.</item>
              <item>Su Kyi's home: The Junction was filled with soldiers driving away and arresting
                supporters who go to her home, September 29 &amp; 30 1996.</item>
              <item>Interview on September 30 1996:SLORC released Suu Kyi. "Dialogue is the ultimate
                tool to solve problems in Burma. Dialogue is not a boxing match in which one will
                beat up the other to win. If conditions and the environment change toward an
                acceptable level, NLD will join the convention."</item>
              <item>NLD is being marginalized due to the convention. The economy has never been good
                enough. 40% to 90% of the farmers are starving due to the government's
                export-oriented policy which forces farmers to sell crops with the government
                prices. Investment is never good for the public but good to the few close to SLORC.
                NLD has no intention to strip those who are rich due to SLORC's policy. NLD won't
                lead the country back to 1988. We will lead the country ahead.</item>

                (SLORC) cease fire was not a successful one because people still carry arms. When
                peace prevails there is no need for people to hold arms."</item>
              <item>Drug addiction is at a dangerous level. There is not enough evidence to conclude
                money laundering of drug sources. Suu Kyi is still organizing the National League
                for Democracy (NLD) and is not ready to go around the country. NLD is elected by
                people. Journalists want news. Ethnic issue has to be addressed democratically.
                Among Burmese there is a lack of trust.</item>
              <item>Supporters were waiting for Suu Kyi outside. As she emerged, people chanted,
                "Good Health to Daw Aung San Su Kyi! Good health to Uncle U Tin Oo &amp; Uncle U Kyi
                Maung!"</item>
              <item>Q &amp; A: Democracy is the truth and the appropriate ideology for everyone.The
                other side is dictatorship, which is very harmful to the people. There is a
                difference between the silence of fear and the rule of law. Pandit Neru's government
                should reveal truth and justice. Law and order are rules of discipline. The
                government must not ignore the will of the people.</item>
              <item>Suu Kyi explains the characteristics of being a good king. "A good king observes
                moral and spiritual leadership in a country. He does not give away truthfulness. He
                sacrifices. He does not lie nor trick the people. He always listens and analyzes the
                people. Opportunists around the king are often dangerous." Democracy is to respect
                the equitable right of every individual.</item>

              <item>SLORC's justification for holding power and denial of the massacres in 1988.
                SLORC's version of the 1988 people's uprising: Communist party, foreign news
                agencies and human rights agencies were blamed as instruments in the civil and
                political unrest. Beheading those accused of poisoning the drinking water and
                attempt to sabotage the demonstration.</item>
              <item>Ohn Gyaw spoke: "The truth was overshadowed by the money making reports. No
                nation would tolerate such challenges andthey would absolutely deal with it the way
                we did. Changes were indeed already in place. The emergency Party Congress was held
                on the 23rd July 1988 when Ne Win announced his retirement and pushed for a
                referendum. But it was rejected. Sein Lwin was elected, but when he was unable to
                contain the disturbances he was replaced by Dr. Maung Maung. During those days,
                demonstrators caused massive destruction. Peace, order and the rule of law were
                challenged. Tatmadaw was the only organized and disciplined entity left in the
                country. It assumed power to stop the disintegration of the country."</item>
              <item>Burma Communist Party Politburo meeting was shown with detailed discussion
                translated into English.</item>
              <item>"Demonstrators demanded a multiparty democracy to which the government agreed.
                But the formation of an interim government was the communist party's agenda. The
                slogans used by the demonstrators were communist party slogans. In the video clip
                communist leaders discussed taking power by turning down the interim government. The
                conclusion was that the people's uprising was nothing but the Communist plan to
                assumepower. To make the situation worse, the news agencies abroad spread rumors and
                fabricated reports on Burma and her government. Some human rights agencies
                instigated with unrelated and irrelevant issues. Force was used to protect the
                government property and only a handful were killed or wounded, unlike what was put
                in the foreign reports. Brutal beheading scenes were shown but it is stated that
                foreign journalists only recorded the bad things. Those beheaded, according to the
                mob, were the residents of the government-sponsored housing projects who were paid
                to poison the drinking water by Ne Win's daughter Sanda Win.</item>
              <item>Due to the brutal acts committed by the mob and the plan of the communist party
                and foreign agitators with vested interests in Burma,the national sovereignty and
                security were in danger. So Tatmadaw is ready to sacrifice for the good of Burma. It
                formed SLORC and assumed power. Eventually, law and order were reinstalled. Tatmadaw
                successfully saved Burma.</item>

                that sanction hurts the public is only the voice of the businessmen, not the public.
                Sanctions to State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) won't hurt the Burmese
                majority. An example is the sanctions on Iraq. They should be partial sanctions
                while allowing humanitarian sectors to operate."</item>
              <item>Response to Dr. Maung Maung's comment on spending three months to write the
                constitution: Now it has been 6 years. They are incapable of handling it properly.
                And six years has also passed since the election was successfully done, yet nothing
                has done towards democracy. People's will is as strong as ever. Economic changes
                will not alter the people's desire for democracy. The ASEAN stand is so wrong. Doing

              <item>Interview: The arrests are not totally unexpected. State Law and Order
                Restoration Council (SLORC) has been nervous whenever NLD makes a move, even when it
                is a normal political activity. The response was based on the extent of their fear.
                Lt. Gen Kyaw Thein's comment was that there is no need for opposition. He doesn't
                understand the democracy.</item>
              <item>The Rule of law prevents anarchy, but SLORC broke the law. They broke Section
                339 and section 340, arresting people without warrant, and forcing NLD delegates to
                leave Rangoon. SLORC put forth a campaign against her money and her consulting with
                foreign powers. She was required to submit bank statements. Business people need to
                note that SLORC does not respect the fundamental business privacy law. The arrest of
                600 did not help them get any solid evidence that NLD collaborates with foreign
                sources, Uncles' (U Tin Oo, U Kyi Maung) cars were often stopped. SLORC pressured
                the landlords to take the NLD sign off the township offices and closed down some.
                But we will put back as soon as possible.</item>
              <item>SLORC's tactic on diversifying NLD: Aung Shwe is good while Tin Oo and Kyi Maung
                are stubborn. While Aung San Suu Kyi was detained Aung Shwe was good but when she
                rejoined army Aung Shwe behaved very badly. No permission will be issued for any
                other mass meetings.</item>
              <item>Responding to SLORC's accusations that her speeches instigate the public, create
                splits in army and portray bad images of the government: "My statements are always
                true. I don't make up stories."</item>
              <item>On bad impression of the government: "SLORC has more access to the media.
                Splitting the army can not be known by anyone except military itself. That was their
                business."</item>
              <item>On government needing cooperation: "NLD always offers open dialogues. We
                contacted them through MI but they always said it was not the time yet."</item>
              <item>National convention should be recognized and changed more in an appropriate
                time. But when looked back at 104 basic principles there was no way one could
                change.</item>

                becomes the stronger the people support democracy and NLD. "In 1996 and '97, SLORC
                was invited to join ASEAN and claimed to have 4.5 billion dollar investment. They

              <item>Evan William met Information Minister Col. Kyaw Thein, who said: "Dialogue with
                NLD won't work. Army is considering it very carefully not to make mistakes and not
                to break promises. U Tin Oo is staging personal vendetta against some army
                officials. Suu Kyi won't be detained as long as she does not become obstacle in
                SLORC's way; otherwise she will be removed." Boasted about his performance in the
                North, he said they had captured all the Kachin Independent Army (KIA)'s
                headquarters. Tourism is open from Kachin State up to Putao. Khunsa is being
                investigated. He accused Thai officials and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of
                having connection with Khunsa. He said former Mong Tai Army (MTA) area can become
                tourist spot soon.</item>

              <item>Lt. Col. Hla Min was interviewed by Heather Kelly: Q: Why did you have to shut
                the whole college if you claimed only few students joined it (regarding the November
                1996 student protest)? A: Schools were suspended based on the decision of students,
                parents and teachers. Students and Labor Unions cannot be allowed. SLORC is
                undertaking a nation building process. It goes step by step. Good time will
                certainly come. Every family has at least one soldier so army and people are one.
                Army is one big family of the people. The outside opinion is not important to SLORC.
                Achieving the objectives and how people value SLORC's achievements are more
                important. Sanction does not hit the government. Government does not care. Give
                SLORC another 5 years they will industrialize the country. Investments are working
                just fine, making changes to people of all levels. There are 9 times more cars on
                the streets. Cemeteries have to go. There is no exemption. They have to give way to
                development. Aung San Suu Kyi may continue her weekend speeches as long she keeps it
                in her compound. Press Conferences will continue and visa will be issued before
                hand.</item>

              <item>Suu Kyi appeared in Burmese traditional orange "Yinzeat" blouse and a bunch of
                "Thazin pan" on her head: "There is overwhelming message of hope, courage, strength
                as well as suffering of women around the world. She has been freed from house arrest
                only one month. There is tremendous duty of continuing the struggle for freedom. For
                all the problems of the world, the end is when peace, security, human rights, and
                democracy are granted for every human being. Women must participate in politics as
                men do. No wars have ever started by women but most victims have been women and
                children. After the cold war leaders must invest on social and educational
                development and public health instead of wars. Tolerance is the key to peace.
                Ignoring is not tolerance. Understanding and appreciation are the tolerance. The
                relationship between men and women should not be patronage and dominance.It must be
                appreciation and gratitude. Women in Burma are struggling for democracy. It is time
                for forgiveness and reconciliation."</item>

              <item>A film directed by John Boorman, starring Aung Ko and Patricia Arquette:</item>
              <item>At her sister's suggestion, Laura Boorman, a doctor from United States, who just
                lost her husband and son in a robbery, took a trip to the exotic east hoping to find
                peace. She landed in Burma in August 1988 at the peak of the people's uprising
                against the military regime demanding democratic changes in the country. She was
                unable to leave Burma because she lost her passport. Attempting to move around town,
                she met her former professor, Aung Ko, now an unofficial tourist guide and they
                ventured out to the North. After the car broke down they were forced to stay with
                student activists in Prome. They exchanged ideas. Laura could not understand why a
                government could be so cruel to its own people. The morning came, they tried to
                escape to Rangoon but the army killed a student. She and Aung Ko hardly escaped the
                gun shots and managed to sail down to Rangoon on a bamboo raft. Rangoon was already
                in chaos. Troops shot and killed thousands on the streets. Unable to reach the US
                embassy, Laura Aung Ko and the students fled Burma on a truck and later on foot till
                they reached the Karen controlled area. Again under fire they successfully crossed
                border to Thailand. Laura decided to volunteer in the Refugee camp crammed with the

              <item>On Aung San Suu Kyi:An extremely courageous woman led a nation into freedom. The
                army tried to silence her through house arrest. Yet for 40 million of her people she
                is the symbol of hope. On the fifth anniversary of her house arrestthere were
                demonstrations in front of the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC)
                embassy in London and the symbolic jailing of two British MPs attracted the world
                media.</item>
              <item>Yuzana Khin was interviewed while campaigning for democracy through her show
                across America. "I'll struggle with her for Burma no matter how long it takes." She
                showed the prolonged discontent over ruthlessness and corruption of army. The 1988
                uprising was caused by only a tea shop argument, the argument between students and
                local folks over what music to play. Army opened fire into the crowd and killed
                thousands. The primarily leaderless revolution found their rightful leader - Aung
                San Suu Kyi." As soon as I saw her face, for some reason I knew she is the one we
                have been looking for (Yuzana Khin)." Aung San Suu Kyi was only 2 when her father
                was assassinated. But she studied his past.</item>
              <item>(Prof. Josef Silverstein): Aung San Suu Kyi raised two children as a Buddhist. A
                shin Byu scene - In September 1988, when SLORC took power and promised election,
                National League for Democracy led by Aung San Suu Kyi was formed. She covered
                campaign trails by plane, by boat, and by train, reaching everyone. The message was
                the same: democracy. People welcome her tremendously. Army harassed her campaign
                constantly and finally SLORC locked her up. Congressmen Bill Richardson visited the
                prisoners and Aung San Suu Kyi.Furniture was scarce because she sold it in order to
                eat. It did look like a prison.National League for Democracy (NLD) won landslide
                victory over rivals including the SLORC backed National Unity Party. Army not only
                did not honor the promise but stepped up the crackdown on the elected NLD members
                and insisted on their version ofNational Convention. Elected MPs were either jailed
                or intimidated. Some escaped and managed to put up parallel government in Washington
                DC. Dr. Sein Win, acting Prime Minister of National Coalition Government of the
                Union of Burma (NCGUB) said: "The West is not doing enough. "Hollywood shot a movie
                called "Beyond Rangoon" about this story.</item>

                Aung San Suu Kyi. But it was a stunt. In spite of all the efforts to silent her and
                her cause, the movement became stronger, not weaker.</item>

                the will of leaders who want to rule with absolute power. Democracy is people's
                involvement in politics. That was how the 1988 people's upraising took place in
                Burma.People were fed up. They needed only a spark to start the full blown
                revolution. That uprising was cracked down. She knew the right time had come.
                National League for Democracy (NLD) was formed for the election. Aung San Suu Kyi's
                name was magic. State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) started to disrupt
                her and finally kept her under house arrest. In spite of all kind of oppression, NLD
                won the election. SLORC ignored the results and jailed the MPs. When released in
                1995 she began the gate speeches. Fear was the most destructive factor in
                Burma.</item>
              <item>Suu Kyi said she was honored to receive this award on behalf of everyone who
                struggled for democracy in Burma and the people of Burma. Human rights abuses did
                not decline. They worsened instead. NLD had been harassed. Many working committees
                were forced to close. With help of the people who love peace and justice and the
                relentless will of the people to be free we will achieve our goal.</item>

              <item>Message: In 1998, State Peace and Development Council (SPCD) (formerly State Law
                and Order Restoration Council [SLORC]) stepped up the already worsened human rights
                abuses, making mass arrests of National League for Democracy (NLD) MPs and members.
                It was the Junta's response on NLD's attempt to convene the people's assembly with
                elected MPs. The NLD suffered eight months of last year over the past nine years of
                party's existence.</item>
              <item>Authorities acted like criminals in persecuting NLD. A lawsuit was filed against
                Ministry of Home and Military Intelligence but was not acted upon.We need concrete
                action, not just lip services.</item>
              <item>Comments on crack down: 150 MPs and 300 more members are in detention. Many were
                held without any charges.Many people don't know there are basic rights; people live
                in fear; no rule of law prevails. Since 1962 people have been living in constant
                fear of being persecuted.</item>
              <item>Comments on right of children: Burma signed the convention but did not respect
                it. Extremely malnourished children were often seen in the center of Rangoon. Many
                can't afford elementary education.</item>
              <item>Comments on child labor: Not much now in business sector because construction
                boom has died out. But many were seen in government projects.</item>
              <item>Comments on law for children and women: there is no such rule of law.</item>
              <item>Comments on present condition: Women and children are prime victims of
                instability in a country.Many turn to prostitution in hopes of a better life but
                many are facing starvation.</item>

              <item>The Speech:(In yellow Yinpone) Since the release of Aung San Suu Kyi nothing has
                so far changed toward democratization. The regime is doing everything to block the
                ways of democratization in Burma in the name of justice, peace and progress. Aung
                San Suu Kyi appealed to the international community to work for the implementation
                of United Nations Resolution on early return of democracy in Burma.</item>
              <item>Current economic situation in Burma: Price of petrol tripled, immediately
                causing abrupt price rise that hit the population. Inflation was painfully high. A
                few wealthy people got richer but the vast majority suffered.</item>
              <item>Investment. It did not benefit the ordinary people. Farming sector is worse off.
                Farmers are forced to sell their products to army with fixed price. People
                starved.</item>
              <item>Labor: No labor union to protect the laborers' rights.</item>
              <item>Current Political Situation: No one is absolutely safe under this regime.
                Government arrests anyone as they please. Government has no respect for its fellow
                citizens.</item>

                Year celebration at Mae La camp, the DKBA, with the help of Burma army, executed a
                series of cross border raids, and burned and killed the refugees. Thai Army refused
                to do anything.The KNU 4th Brigade commander, "Oliver,"was interviewed. KNU with All
                Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF) abandoned the fixed camp warfare and
                adopted guerrilla warfare. Thai army turned away male refugees. Many were still
                trapped in the Burma side of jungle. Soldiers were ordered to kill anyone who tried
                to flee or returned to the village to collect food they left behind. Refugees had to
                live on roadsides and everywhere. Rumors of not being accepted by Thai authority
                scared away hundreds. They went back to the malaria-infested jungles. There was no
                medicine and not enough food.</item>

              <item>This documentary is based on the findings of a 1998 report published by the
                International Labor Organization (ILO) inquiry on forced labor issues in Burma. The
                ILO found Burma guilty of "widespread and systematic forced labor," turning the
                country into "a virtual slave labor camp." The regime refused to attend ILO
                hearings, denying any use of forced labor.</item>
              <item>Laborers include men, women, elderly and children. They are forced to purchase
                the materials that they are forced to work on.</item>
              <item>Footage: road construction, laborers loading baskets with rocks, construction
                sites, workers in rural rice fields, poverty, villagers working on farms, soldiers
                marching through streets, paper orders from the army demanding quotas for forced
                labor, convict labor, construction of foreign investments and tourist sites, gas
                pipeline construction for Total and Unocal, emptied villages used for production
                sites.</item>
              <item>Interviews include: Bill Jordan, International Confederation of Trade Unions;
                Justice Bhagwati, ILO Commissioner; Lt. Col. Hal Min, Burmese Military Spokesman;
                Pierre Sane, Secretary General of Amnesty International; testimonies smuggled out of
                Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi, National League for Democracy (NLD) Leader; Robyn Layton,
                ILO Commissioner.</item>
              <item>Lt. Col. Hal Min (Military Representative): "Myanmar is a very strong Buddhist
                nation...our traditions, our culture does not allow for these things to happen. We
                get very frustrated when all these accusations are thrown at us when they say this
                is Myanmar at this present moment, this is something that really frustrates the
                government, not only the government, also the people of Myanmar"; Daw Aung San Suu
                Kyi: "Practically all roads built by the government use forced labor, roads,
                bridges, clearing out the jungle. All this needs forced labor because there is no
                other way the government can get this done.And we do not have the kind of machinery
                that will enable us to get these kind of projects going quickly. So it's human power
                that they need, man power, forced labor power"; International Labor Organization
                (ILO) Report: "Workers were not paid or compensated in any way for providing their
                labor, other than in exceptional circumstances...and were commonly subjected to
                various forms of verbal and physical abuse, including rape, torture, and killing";
                Unidentified woman(working on road): "The biggest fine is 500 Kyat. If we don't dig
                a ditch or canal, we pay 500 Kyat. What can we do? We're poor. It's a daily struggle
                to get food. Now we're here, we have to do this forced labor. I wonder what's
                happening at home."</item>
              <item>According to this documentary, locals were angry when they were ordered to
                demolish the ancient pagodas and monasteries to build new ones. The ancient
                artifacts were taken away. Voice-over: DANA is Burmese word for contributing to
                Buddha. When the government forces people to do Dana, it is like they have exhorted
                the position of Buddha.</item>
              <item>Documentary also reports on foreign companies contributing to the use of forced
                labor. Total and Unocal built Yadana pipeline with forced labor, although the
                companies deny this.</item>

              <item>Aung San Suu Kyi said she read a lot and listened to the radio, but chose not to
                write because she did not want State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) to
                see her writings. She thanks the people around the world for their support and
                stresses the importance ofthe opinion of the international community.</item>

              <item>From a United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) report: "Many children in Burma

              <item>Opening remark: National League for Democracy (NLD) members are harassed. Human
                rights is a universal element. Rule of law is a concept of peace. There is no Rule
                of Law in Burma. We should appeal to the international community to take greater
                interest in the restoration of democracy in Burma. NLD wrote to State Law and Order
                Restoration Council (SLORC) about five instances of human rights violations. Two
                duties of NLD: protest lawlessness of SLORC and implementation of UN
                Resolution.Concrete steps should be taken to fulfill people's will. Economic
                progress can not be guaranteed without the rule of law. We have called trying to
                establish dialogues but SLORC chose to ignore. The situation in Burma is threatening
                regional stability.</item>

                regime.</item>
              <item>John Pilger: "More than a million people have been forced from their homes and,
                according to the UN, untold thousands have been massacred, tortured and subjected to
                a modern form of slavery. 'Burma, says Amnesty International, is a prison without
                bars.'"</item>
              <item>According to Pilger, the filming for this documentary was done in secret as the
                regime attempted to cover its crimes with the help of foreign investors and by
                declaring 1996 the year of the tourist.</item>

              <item>The Inya Lake massacre - the site where the March 16, 1988 student demonstration
                took place.Pilger: "According to eyewitnesses, the soldiers beat many of them to
                death, singling out the girls. Those who escaped were pursued here into the lake,
                where they were caught and drowned one by one. Of the survivors, 42 were locked into
                a waiting van and left in the noon-day heat where all of them suffocated to death.
                In the meantime fire engines were brought in to wash away the blood."</item>

                supplies to an area where a billion dollar gas line is being built for the French

              <item>Scenes of children used as laborers, carrying clumps of clay on their heads.
                Pilger: "Children are also forced to make bricks for the army, and that construction

              <item>Interview with James Sherwhood, Chairman of Orient Express Hotels, Road to
                Mandalay River Cruises. He claims that there is no proof that there are human rights
                violations in Burma. He claims that he consulted with the CIA who told him that the
                allegations were not true. He says that it is "untactful" to contact the "opposition
                leader" Aung San Suu Kyi. He met only with the generals.</item>
              <item>Pilger claims that the Burmese government receives money from foreign investors
                - mainly gas companies. British company also traded arms with the government. United
                States, Japan, and Australian companies also trade with Burma. NHK, a Japanese media
                organization, told the filmmakers of this documentary that they cannot share the
                footage of soldiers killing civilians because it is "too delicate and might threaten
                Myanmar's stability. Please erase the materials from your library. I appreciate you

              <item>Karen refugees: Women were forcibly taken away by soldiers. We have never seen
                them again. State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) terrorizes the ethnic
                minorities. Women and children were brutalized, a soldier confirmed. There were
                unbelievable abuses. Some known abuses were conducted by Sgt. Ba Gyi. A girl was
                picking vegetables but Ba Gyi took her and raped her. She lay unconscious next to
                the road. She was later sent to a hospital, but she died.</item>
              <item>In the Tachileik town, 1995, soldiers exposed themselves in front of the girls.
                Some pointed guns at women, looted jewelry and raped them. "We took everything from
                every village we went across. If one could not pay he had to work. We have been on
                the move since 1995. We left whenever we heard gun shots. Family structure was
                destroyed. I have no parents and I don't know where they are."</item>
              <item>Malaria and anemia are common. Children suffer from bad health and poverty and
                receive little education. They shifted schools into work skill training camps. They
                transported women to Thailand to meet the Thai demand for its sex market and for
                cheap labor. Ranong, a Burmese, found this a disappointment. "Many Burmese are
                exploited. Many have been sold. If dictatorship stays in power for long we are in
                trouble."</item>

                and traded them. "We don't know how to manufacture heroin. We have to ask traders

                implemented. The SPDC tried to intimidate the Burmese people, but has never tried
                for a genuine dialogue. We don't enjoy basic rights. The Burmese people are being
                deprived ofbasic human rights. The National League for Democracy (NLD) is subjected
                to severe repression. The regime created economic and political chaos, with the
                result that millions crossed into neighboring countries. Ethnic minorities are being
                targeted by the regime and they have fled into Thailand by the tens of thousands. I
                beg neighboring countries to extend humanitarian help to the refugees. The UN
                resolution on Burma is clear. Help any way you can to enable the UN resolution to be
                implemented.</item>

              <item>July 1945, the Japanese are losing the war in Burma. The Japanese have retreated
                from every front. From one unit hiding deep in the jungle is a harp-playing soldier
                named Mitzushima. His unit surrendered to allied forces. Commissioned to convince
                other units to surrender, he wandered, visiting other companies. His unit was
                crushed after refusing to surrender but he survived. Pretending to be a Buddhist
                Monk, while trying to reunite with his mother unit, he sees dead Japanese soldiers
                scattered about Burma. He feels responsible for burying the dead and does it
                single-handedly, never rejoining his company again. He stays behind in Burma
                although his unit leaves Burma to rejoin Japan.</item>

              <item>Dr. Cynthia Maung: People show incredible spirit. The clinic is for internally
                displaced people. The students, church groups and Burmese overseas are helped first.
                Malaria is the main admission, as well as HIV and Tuberculosis. The patient number
                is growing. We have different units to treat different patients. There are more
                migrant workers now. Sixty others help in the clinic. Most deaths were caused by
                malaria, infection, malnutrition and violence.Public education is now
                extended.</item>
              <item>We are migrant workers.Medic across the border is at great risk. After the
                deportation the patient number is greatly reduced but there are more severe
                cases.</item>
              <item>We need to see effective and sustainable development. Suffering is growing
                despite hard work and prayers. Over a million are infected by HIV virus.</item>
              <item>We should stop the narcotic flow. Thai shows interestin working together but has
                put in place many restrictions. Twenty Burmese are killed everyday in Thailand.
                Narcotics problem grows. Thai employers do not take responsibility. There are unsafe
                abortions and abandoned babies. Mental health is important. Health education program
                is working very well. My busiest day can be from 6 am to midnight.</item>
              <item>Scene of the clinic: One patient says, "It is impossible to get treatment in
                Burma. It is too expensive and we are often ignored. A patient had to be referred to
                Myawaddy hospital to get diagnosis and then cameback for medication. There is
                absolutely no medicine in Burma for us."</item>
              <item>Win Win Mar: "People suffer severe illness. My father went to Bangkok and never
                came back."</item>
              <item>Serious patients.</item>
              <item>Min Zin (Student Activist Leader): My father spentlong time in jail. My parents
                showed me what is going on in my country. 1988 my sisters were arrested and I took
                part since June 1988. I was associated with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. I kept underground
                since 1988 until 1997. People support democracy. I have to hide whenever they
                search. I received a lot of help from people. Working inside Burma is much
                meaningful. The problems: Lack of communication. Lack of space.</item>
              <item>Seven years jail sentence is imposed for youth that set up the library.</item>
              <item>Junta not ask for support only tolerance. Be more aggressive. A change can be
                seen in 24 hours. Demonetization broke the people's spirit.</item>

                and brightest. Usually Myanmar elite. Staggering robust economy and people's

                cultural value.</item>
              <item>Opposition is blamed for the economic demise and sanctions. This film seems
                intent on creating a rift between the people and opposition. Moral degradation and
                corruption among the people, especially the female population. An incredible
                friendship, unbelievable honesty,amazing leadership. Hardship among the people
                inflicted by sanctions. Family values, birth control campaign.</item>

                Students are the heroes. I stayed abroad, I am married to a foreigner, but it is
                wrong to think that due to such circumstances my love for Burma is less than anyone
                else. Our family knew the best how hard my father worked. I joined the uprising
                because this is the affair of the whole country. Being Bo Gyuke's daughter, I could
                not just sit back home. We can call this upraising the second struggle for
                independence based on the will of the people. Always united. Unity is the key for
                democracy. Discipline, peace is important. Students are fine and courageous and have
                shown physical strength. Hope to see their metal strength. No one is behind the
                students. Pure desire to gain democracy. I never support the political opportunists.

                joined KNDO. I served several positions and placesin KNU. We do not kill prisoners
                of war. This is the biggest difference from State Law and Order Restoration Council
                (SLORC) army. We allow him to defect or send him home. Burmese army rapes the female
                captives but we never do that. We are brothers not enemies. We must be different
                from enemy otherwisewe do not need to fight. My youngest brother died in the war. I
                sought revenge in blood. In a decisive victory I had my revenge. I realized that I
