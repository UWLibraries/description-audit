            American Expeditionary Force, stationed in Siberia during World War I. Collection
            includes photographs and postcards from Sears' travels during his military service. Some
            of these are labeled as being from Vladivostok, Russia; others are of an unidentified
            Asian country, and still others are of Honolulu and miscellaneous naval vessels. The
            majority of the photographs are black and white prints or images sized 3.5x5.5 inches;
            most do not have labels or descriptions. There are also 4 panoramas that will require
            additional conservation work. In addition, there are some miscellaneous papers from
            Sears' post-war work on railroads, as well as research and photocopies about his
            military service.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical and Historical Note</head>
         <p>The Raleigh H. Sears Photograph Collection was acquired by Duke University through David
            Alexander, whose father, Robert Alexander, was the collector of this material. The
            Alexanders spent a lot time researching the life and military service of Sears, whose
            collection has no identifying information. Their research and photocopies are available
            in the collection for researchers using this material.</p>
         <p>According to the Alexanders, Raleigh Sears enlisted in the U.S. Army on 5 March 1917,
            and was stationed in San Diego during much of World War I. Muster rolls reveal that he
            was on the USS <title type="simple" render="italic">Albany</title> by April 1919, and in
            June 1919 was serving detached duty at the U.S. Naval Radio Station on Russian Island,
            near Vladivostok. Records show he was sick in April 1920, and he appears to have been
            transported to the Marine Barricks National Station in the Philippines by September
            1920, and was back in the United States at the Navy Yard Mare Island, California, by
            November 1920. He was discharged with the rank of private, first class, in January 1921.
            Nothing is known about his activities post-war, except that an insurance policy dated
            1926 reveals he was a coal chute man for a Montana railroad company.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>This collection consists largely of unlabeled photographs dating from Raleigh Sears'
            military service in the American Expeditionary Force during and immediately following
            World War I. The photographs are supplemented by captioned postcards, some color tinted,
            which appear to date from the same period. The postcards and photographs include images
            from the travels of Sears' unit, including stops in Hawaii, Asia, and Siberia. The
            majority of these photographs are of scenery, rather than of the troops or military
            images. However, there are notable images of ships, posing sailors and soldiers, and
            buildings like a YMCA. </p>
         <p>Hawaii appears only briefly in images that are labeled as Honolulu. The photographs from
            Asia document the scenery, buildings, and people of an unidentified country: it is
            likely either Japan or China. Occasionally these photographs include images of an
            American soldier interacting with local people or posing for a picture. There is no
            label confirming that this man is Sears. The postcards also include images from Asia, at
            times uncaptioned. Some of the Asia postcards are scenery in Yokohama, Japan.</p>
         <p>The scenes from Siberia are easier to identify. There are several photographs of dead,
            snow-covered men on the ground, usually with other soldiers looking over the corpses. It
            is unclear where in Siberia these events occured, and no labels exist for those
            photographs. The postcards from Siberia are typically of scenes from Vladivostok,
            including the arrival of troops and views over the port. </p>
         <p>The collection also includes 4 panoramic images: 3 rolled photographs and 1 folded
            postcard. Two photographs and the postcard are scenic photographs of Vladivostok. The
            third panoramic photograph is a formal portrait of troops, unlabeled and undated.</p>
         <p>There are also five photographs of Raleigh Sears' family members.</p>
         <p>The photographs in this collection are accompanied by David and Robert Alexander's
            research on Raleigh Sears' military service, as well as a few miscellaneous papers from
            his post-war life. The most significant of these his an insurance policy from a railroad
            company, which reveals that he was a coal chute man in 1926. The rest of the collection
            includes some documentation on the life of Robert Alexander.</p>
