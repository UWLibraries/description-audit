      <p>Henry Noel Brailsford was the most prolific British left-wing journalist of the first half
        of the 20th century. A founding member of the Men's League for Women's Suffrage in 1907, he
        resigned from his job at The Daily News in 1909 when it supported the force-feeding of
        suffragettes on hunger strike. Around 1910, Brailsford wrote to Millicent Fawcett, the
        leader of the National Union of Woman's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), suggesting that he
        should attempt to establish a Conciliation Committee for Women's Suffrage. A Conciliation
        Committee, composed of 36 MPs (25 Liberals, 17 Conservatives, 6 Labour and 6 Irish
        Nationalists) all in favour of some sort of women's enfranchisement, was formed and drafted
        a Bill which would have enfranchised only a million women but which would, they hoped, gain
        the support of all but the most dedicated anti-suffragists.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection comprises two letters from Henry Noel Brailsford to (John Howard?) Whitehouse,
        probably written in 1911. In the first letter, dated 31 January, Brailsford urges Whitehouse
        to get his Committee to cooperate with the Conciliation Committee in getting a Conciliation
        Bill passed ("... the P.M. is more likely to listen to your Committee"). Brailsford also
        tries to enlist Whitehouse to help him find new members for the Conciliation Committee: "If
        you see any Liberals who are good suffragists &amp; are not averse in principle from working
        with Tories, I hope you will invite them to join us." In the second letter, dated 3 March,
        Brailsford discusses Whitehouse's decision to resign and urges him to reconsider. The
        resignation was (presumably) over the Conciliation Committee's handling of an inquiry into
        the violent clash between suffragettes from the Women's Social and Political Union and the
        police on 1910 November 18 at the House of Commons. On stationery of the Conciliation
        Committee for Woman Suffrage. Includes transcripts for both letters.</p>
