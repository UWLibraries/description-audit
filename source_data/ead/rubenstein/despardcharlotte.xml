      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Charlotte Despard (1844-1939) was the author of ten novels and a noted suffragist. In 1890,
        widowed after 20 years of marriage, Despard dedicated her life to helping the poor. She
        funded and staffed a health clinic and soup kitchen. In 1907, Despard and other members of
        the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU) created The Women’s Freedom League. They left
        the WSPU over disagreements about the leadership and use of vandalism. The Women’s Freedom
        League constitution states the main objective was to “secure for Women the Parliamentary
        Vote as it is or may be granted to men.” They advocated refusal to pay taxes, refusal to
        fill out the 1911 census forms, and they objected to the War in 1914. The organization grew
        rapidly and had 60 branches across Britain and 4,000 members. Its newspaper, The Vote, was
        produced by Charlotte Despard and Teresa Billington-Greig. Living in Dublin during the Irish
        War of Independence, Despard supported the Irish republican movement. In 1930, Despard
        joined the Communist Party of Great Britain.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection contains four letters. Three are written in Depard’s hand and signed. A Postcard
        to C.H. Grinling speaks of canvassing (7 March 1903). A letter of condolence addressed to
        Mr. Webb Smith (3 February 1911). A letter to Mr. Grinling reacting to statements made by
        Mr. Asquith in May of 1911. Despard hopes that Asquith’s remarks would incite women to “draw
        all the societies together in common action – our watchword being ‘On the same terms as
        men.’” (14 November 1911). A printed invitation to visit Mrs. Despard at home on the
        occasion of her 90th birthday (27 June 1934)</p>
