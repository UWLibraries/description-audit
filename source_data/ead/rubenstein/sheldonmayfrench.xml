        on one sheet of paper. Sheldon wrote (1883 October 3) to a "Miss Powell" regarding her
        travel plans. The letter was perhaps accompanied by the clipping regarding her activities
        and photograph reproduction of her that are also present in the collection. Another writer,
        "Minnie," forwarded Sheldon's letter to her parents by writing her own letter on the back.
        She mentioned that she visited Charles Dickens' daughter-in-law, and that she was on tour
        with "Maud," who may have been American actress Maude Adams. She added that "Miss [Susan
        B.?] Anthony is still here, but will leave for America soon. She is very proud of Maud as a
        representative American girl."</abstract>
