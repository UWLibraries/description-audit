        11 inch photograph album belonging to an unidentified member of the 45th Engineer General
        Service Regiment, a segregated unit of African American soldiers stationed in Ledo, India
        beginning in 1942. Their charge was to build a portion of the Stilwell Road, a major supply
        route from India to China. Mounted on loose pages, the 44 black-and-white snapshots include
        posed and candid images of individuals and groups of African American soldiers, at work and
        at rest. Soldiers identified in the captions include Charley Woodard, Clarence Benson,
        Charles J. Greene, and Cain Walker. There are also photographs of buildings on the base,
        including Battalion Chapel, headquarters (labeled "The Gateway to Hell"), Harmony Church,
        and a large Stilwell Road sign, along with various shots of military equipment, a "Coolie
        Camp," the "laundry man," and the Taj Mahal. Acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin
        Research Center for African and African American History and Culture.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Stilwell Road, a supply route running more than a thousand miles from India to Burma
        and China, was built chiefly by African American soldiers and local inhabitants almost
        throughout the whole of World War II. Named after General Joseph Stilwell of the U.S. Army
        in 1945, it was originally known as the Ledo Road. The soldiers in the album seem to have
        been with the 45th Engineer General Service Regiment, 382 Engineer Combat Battalion, United
        States Army.</p>

      <p>Collection comprises a 16-page, 8 1/2 x 11 inch photograph album belonging to an
        unidentified member of the 45th Engineer General Service Regiment, one of at least four
        segregated units of African American soldiers active, stationed in Ledo, India beginning in
        1942. Their charge was to build a portion of the Stilwell Road, a military supply route from
        Ledo in Assam, India, through Burma, to Kunming, China. </p>
      <p>The album's original binder is no longer present. Mounted on the loose pages are 44
        black-and-white snapshot photographs, most measuring 3 x 4 1/2 inches, some with brief
        captions in ink. The images include posed and candid snapshots of individuals and groups of
        African American soldiers, at work on the base and during periods of rest. Soldiers
        identified in the captions include Charley Woodard, Clarence Benson, Charles J. Greene, and
        Cain Walker. There are also photographs of buildings on the base, including Battalion
        Chapel, headquarters (labeled "The Gateway to Hell"), Harmony Church, a large Stilwell Road
        sign, along with varied shots of military equipment, a "Coolie Camp," the "laundry man," and
        the Taj Mahal. There are a number of blank pages, and there are some photographs missing. </p>
