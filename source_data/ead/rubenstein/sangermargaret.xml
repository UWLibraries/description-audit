      <abstract id="aspace_1a0c2681fe596d74e8048508f770d91f">The Margaret Sanger letter to Vachel
        Linsday regards a request from the contraception activist to the poet asking him to write a
        statement of support to be read at an upcoming birth control conference. Linsday responds by
        writing a note at the bottom of Sanger's letter replying that he wishes to father "twelve
        sons seven feet high" with the famously long-haired Seven Sutherland Sisters. The
        accompanying pamphlet contains the program for the upcoming conference.</abstract>

      <p>Margaret Sanger was a pioneering American family planning activist who opened the first
        birth control clinic in the United States and founded organizations that evolved into the
        modern Planned Parenthood Federation. Vachel Linsday was a populist American poet who
        traveled extensively performing his works, which were meant to be sung or chanted.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The collection consists of a single-page typescript autograph letter from Margaret Sanger
        to the poet Vachel Lindsay with an autograph manuscript note at the bottom and an
        accompanying single-sheet folded pamphlet. The pamphlet contains the program for the Sixth
        International Neo-Malthusian and Birth Control Conference held in New York March 25-31,
        1925; the letter is composed on matching letterhead and addressed to Lindsay care of the
        Macmillan Company in New York. In the letter, Sanger asks Lindsay if he would be willing to
        compose a message of support to be read at the conference. Lindsay sent the letter back to
        Sanger with a playful manuscript note by way of reply at the bottom signed Nicholas Vachel
        Lindsay. His response states that he wants "twelve sons, seven feet high," and that the best
        way to get them would be "to marry the Seven Sutherland Sisters, as long-haired women have
        long-legged sons." He concludes by asking Sanger if she knows where the Sisters happen to be
        at the time. The Seven Sutherland Sisters were famously long-haired and traveled with Barnum
        and Bailey as a family singing act. In a 1926 letter to the poet Sara Teasdale, Lindsay's
        wife Elizabeth refers to this as "his famous response" to the Neo-Malthusian Conference.</p>
