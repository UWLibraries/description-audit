        worked at the San Antonio General Depot between 1951-1954. Collection comprises a
        commercially produced scrapbook (12 x 14.5 inches) containing 50 black-and-white and 102
        color photographs, ranging in size from 3.5 x 5 inches to 8 x 10 inches. Hernandez and
        several of his friends were female impersonators, so the majority of the photographs are of
        men in various states of drag. Others show Hernandez surrounded by his friends and family or
        in affectionate embraces with gay male friends. Also present are ticket stubs, matchbook
        covers, night club flyers, programs, postcards, and clippings, mostly having to do with
        performance venues and gay clubs in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Antonio, and
        Kansas City, as well as with famous performers. They also document Hernandez's interest in
        Broadway shows, jazz, and actors and actresses. Laid-in are several U.S. Army personnel
        documents from Hernandez's work at the San Antonio General Depot 1951-1954; in addition,
        there are two photographs of Hernandez in uniform. Also laid-in are several other
        photographs, clippings, and programs. Photograph album has been disbound for conservation
        purposes.</abstract>
