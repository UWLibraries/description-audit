         <abstract id="aspace_197392a5abc3fa598c31da40a54feaff">Anna Lora Weiss, born circa 1858,
            lived in Boston's Dorchester section and owned several rental properties throughout the
            city. She was also a member of several voluntary and charitable associations, including
            the Women's Christian Temperance Union, and the Commitee on Music for the School
            Committee of Boston. Her family, including her mother Mary Clapp Weiss, brothers Richard
            and Carl, and sister Mary, were of German descent. Collection contains two account
            books, dated 1896-1904 and 1905-1910 respectively, kept by Anna Lora Weiss of Boston,
            Mass. The account books meticulously document Weiss's income, including significant
            income she received from her rental properties and other investments, as well as her
            expenditures on travel, household goods, gifts, and charitable contributions. In
            addition, the account books indicate that Weiss loaned money at interest to her brother
            Carl for his often unsuccessful business endeavors. In addition to her finances, the
            account books also document Weiss's daily activities and social and political interests.
            Together, the account books reveal that Weiss was an active, independent, and astute
            businesswoman. Acquired as part of the Sallie Bingham Center for Women's History and
            Culture.</abstract>
