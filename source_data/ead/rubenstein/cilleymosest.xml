         <abstract id="aspace_a5ac5ca2548ba2a0e55b40559adf030c">Methodist minister who preached in
            New Hampshire and Massachusetts. Born in Salisbury, Mass., in 1830, to Jonathan Cilley
            and Abigail Fowler; married Sarah A. Eaton in 1849, and died after 1910. Collection
            comprises a volume, 250 pages, filled with handwritten religious essays (called themes
            or lectures, which are sometimes separated into chapters), on the topics of natural
            theology, theism, and creationism versus evolution. Whether the essays were written to
            support the author's theological studies, as material to be presented in convocations,
            or in response to the scientific revelations or debates of the time is unclear; however,
            a reader with initials "J.W.M" read, notated, and provided short comments on the
            contents. Cilley provided a few ink drawings, including a chart showing the geologic
            strata and time periods, as well as an image of the human heart. Many essays contain
            citations to theological writings of the period. Among the many philosophers and writers
            covered are Aristotle, Benedict Spinoza, Thomas Hobbes, d'Alembart, Diderot, Voltaire,
            Alexander Pope, David Hume, Hugh Miller, and Enoch Pond.</abstract>
