      <abstract id="aspace_edaa8f55cac32c8771004a87cb3a42da">Dame Sybil Thorndike was a
        distinguished British actress best known for her work on stage. In this letter to the
        actress and playwright Elizabeth Robins, Thorndike thanks her for the gift of some heather
        from Yorkshire. She also sends her regards and thanks to "Lady Bell" for her support. The
        letter is addressed to Robins at Rounton Grange, the North Yorkshire estate which was the
        family home of the writer Florence Bell ("Lady Bell"). Bell and Robins were close friends
        and collaborators. Thorndike refers to a play; at the time of this letter, she was in
        rehearsals for the 1922-23 London production of Shelley's The Cenci at the New Theater,
        directed by her husband, Lewis Casson. This letter connecting three key female figures of
        the London stage is evidence of the strong support network these women formed in a
        male-dominated arena. </abstract>

      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Dame Sybil Thorndike was a distinguished British actress whose career spanned sixty years,
        mostly on stage. She toured internationally in Shakespearean productions, often appearing
        opposite her husband, Lewis Casson. George Bernard Shaw famously wrote his classic play
        "Saint Joan" specifically with her in mind. Her most notable foray into film was in The
        Prince and the Showgirl (1957), where she appeared alongside Marilyn Monroe. At the time
        this letter was written, Thorndike was in rehearsal for her role as Beatrice in the 1922-23
        London production of Percy Bysshe Shelley's play The Cenci at the New Theater, directed by
        her husband, Lewis Casson. </p>
      <p>Elizabeth Robins was an American actress, playwright, novelist, and suffragist who lived in
        England for many years. She was an associate of Shaw, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, and Virginia
        and Leonard Woolf. </p>
      <p>Dame Florence Bell ("Lady Bell") was a writer and playwright who was Robins' closest friend
        and collaborator. Bell was a key figure in promoting Thorndike's stage career. Her ancestral
        home was Rounton Grange, in North Yorkshire. Robin's 1932 book, Theater and Friendship, is
        in large part about her relationship with Bell.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The collection consists of a single autograph typescript letter from Sybil Thorndike to
        Elizabeth Robins at Rounton Grange, Northallerton in North Yorkshire. In the letter,
        Thorndike thanks Robins for sending her a piece of heather from Rounton Grange. Thorndike
        writes, "I am sure it is going to bring us luck, and I love having something from Rounton on
        my dressing table. How lovely to think of you up there among the peacocks and the glorious
        moors! I really think the play is going to be a success." The letter is signed "yours
        affectionately, Sybil" with a manuscript postscript asking Robins to give her love to Lady
        Bell, and to thank Lady Bell for her support. The letter is composed on Thorndike's own
        letterhead stationery, "Miss Sybil Thorndike" at the address of the New Theater, London and
        listing her husband, Lewis Casson, as Director. The play in production Thorndike refers to
        is Shelley's The Cenci, in which she played the lead, Beatrice. With stamped, postmarked
        envelope.</p>
