         <p>The earliest item in the collection is an 1856 pocket bible owned by Civil War
            Confederate soldier Columbus H. Dixon. There are also two letters (1863, 1864) to his
            wife, Love Ann Dixon, discussing troop activities and smallpox in his company. The
            remaining items are two cased ambrotypes; two calling cards; a small 19th-century
            photograph album, possibly a "friendship" album, containing three cartes-de-visite
            (card-mounted albumen prints) and five tintypes; and 23 cartes-de-visite and tintype
            portraits of members of the Dixon, Falls, Jackson, Campbell, and Allison families of
            North Carolina. </p>
         <p>The portrait sitters include women, children, and men, chiefly residing in King's
            Mountain and Gastonia, N.C. Among the portraits are Columbus H. Dixon as a young man;
            his wife Love Ann Dixon (1832-1909); his daughter Sarah; his son John Kelly Dixon
            (1857-1931), textile mill owner; John Dixon's wife, Hester Wilson Dixon. The latest
            dated photographs are of John K. Dixon's small sons, Kay Dixon (1884-1957), and Arthur
            Mills Dixon (1882-1956), who also served as mayor of Gastonia, N.C. and state senator.
            There are also portraits of members of the Allison and Jackson families, related by
            marriage to the Dixons. There are some unidentified portraits, chiefly among the
            tintypes.</p>
         <p>Many of the albumen photographs bear the name of one of the first commercial traveling
            photographers in the United States, John R. Schorb (1818-1908) of Yorkville, South
            Carolina; others were taken in the studios of J.H. Van Ness of Charlotte, North Carolina
            and W.E. McArthur of Shelby, North Carolina.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>The Dixon family and related members resided in the western Piedmont of North Carolina,
            in Cleveland and Gaston counties, adjacent to the South Carolina border. Columbus H.
            Dixon was captain of the 49th North Carolina Regiment, Company G, "The King's Mountain
            Tigers." He died in 1864 near Petersburg, Virginia. In 1868, Columbus Dixon's widow,
            Love Ann Dixon (1832-1909), married Hugh Allison (1836-1913), who served in the 5th
            Regiment, South Carolina Infantry; Allison moved to Cleveland County, N.C., where he
            resided until his death. Columbus Dixon's son, John Kelly Dixon (1857-1931) became a
            Gastonia, N.C. textile mill operator and owner, and had two sons, Arthur Mills Dixon
            (1882-1956), and Kay Dixon (1884-1957). Arthur Mills Dixon became mayor of Gastonia and
            N.C. state senator.</p>

                  <p>Dixon writes from a camp near Kinston, N.C. He speaks of a false alarm that
                     sent his company out on the field. He mentions reading through Revelations (his
                     bible is in the collection), but says he is "not all together pleasant to the
                     Deity of Parents to their children which I do not believe." He asks his wife to
                     baptize their daughter "Sarah Rosalyne." He follows this with a mention of
                     smallpox in the company.</p>

                  <p>Dixon may have been in Virginia by this time. He begins with an account of
                     company rations, then passes on to his nomination for sheriff of Cleveland
                     County, but says his company is loathe to see him leave if elected. He hopes
                     for a furlough soon. Dixon died near Petersburg, Virginia in December 1864.</p>

               <p>In this series there are 23 loose 19th century-era photographs (tintypes and
                  cartes-de-visite), one photograph album from the same period, and two cased
                  mid-19th century ambrotypes. </p>
               <p>The photo album is probably a "friendship" album, judging from the ages (all young
                  adults) and variety of last names. Several slots in the mounting pages are empty. </p>
               <p>The sitters for the remaining portraits are members of all ages from the Dixon and
                  Allison families, and allied members of the Jackson and Wilson families. Many are
                  annotated with names and dates, but there are a number of unidentified
                  individuals. The images are arranged in rough chronological order. Most are
                  undated, but by using known birth dates and photographers' information, tentative
                  dates have been indicated. The following photographers' imprints are present on
                  many of the cartes-de-visites: John R. Schorb, Yorkville, S.C., W.E. McArthur,
                  Shelby, N.C., and J.H. Van Ness of Charlotte, N.C.</p>
               <p>The series begins with a cased ambrotype of a young Columbus Dixon, resident of
                  King's Mountain, Cleveland County, N.C. (circa 1860), and ends with the children
                  of John Kelly Dixon, Arthur Mills Dixon (b. 1882) and Kay Dixon (b. 1884). </p>

                  <p>Carte-de-visite portrait of an unnamed woman; note on back indicates perhaps
                     this is Sarah Rosalind Dixon, but it does not appear to be the right time
                     period. Seems to have been produced at same time as previous portrait of Hugh
                     Allison so it may be a sister or his first wife. Simple card mount with red
                     border measures 2 1/2 x 4 1/8 inches; albumen print measures 2 1/4 x 3 3/4
                     inches. Photographer's emblem: J.R. Schorb &amp; son, Yorkville, South
                     Carolina. George T. Schorb joined his father as full partner in 1869.</p>
