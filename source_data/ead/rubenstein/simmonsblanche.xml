            (1821-1903), Field Marshal and Colonel Commandant of the Royal Engineers, and his second

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection consists of a single diary that records the events of two distinct trips
            taken by Blanche Simmons and her parents in 1879 and 1880. The first half of the diary
            documents a family vacation to Belgium and the Netherlands from September 19th to
            October 13th, 1879, with stops in Brussels, Spa, Utrecht, Amsterdam, The Hague,
            Rotterdam, Antwerp, and Ghent. The diary describes the sights and the family's
            activities in these cities, in smaller towns, and on nature walks. Art museums and
            churches, as well as the headdresses and clothing worn by local women are described in
            particular detail. Many commercial albumen prints on card stock and dried plant
            specimens are affixed to the diary pages, and the entry for Friday the 3rd includes a
            humorous, rhyming poem relating events of the first half of the trip.</p>
         <p>The second half of the diary documents a trip to Berlin, Germany, from June 11th to July
            9th, 1880, during which Blanche's father, Sir John Simmons, and Major Ardagh attended a
            conference in Berlin for "the settling of the Greek frontier" accompanied by Blanche,
            her mother, and their escort, Captain Wood. As in the earlier vacation, commentary
            chiefly centers on sightseeing with an emphasis on museums, but also relates details of
            the conference, as recounted to Blanche, and describes several formal functions attended
            by her party, including receptions at the British Embassy and a small dinner gathering
            at the New Palace in Potsdam with Crown Prince Friedrick, Crown Princess Victoria of
            Great Britain, Prince Wilhelm, and Princesses Victoria-Augusta and Caroline of
            Schleswig-Holstein. Sights in Cologne, Dresden, and Aachen are also described, and the
            diary concludes with two humorous "Odes," one commemorating the events of the trip and
            the other, a twenty-three stanza piece written by Major Ardagh, on the Conference of
            Berlin.</p>
