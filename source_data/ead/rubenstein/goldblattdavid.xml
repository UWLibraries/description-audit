      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>David Goldblatt was born November 29, 1930 in the South African city Randfontein of the
        province Gauteng. His photographic career began at age eighteen when he began taking
        pictures. With parents and grandparents who fled Lithuania around 1890 to escape from
        religious persecution against Jews, Goldblatt found himself simultaneously a part of white
        society that saw itself as superior, and an object of racial and religious oppression; this
        may explain in part the subjects of his images, which explore and document the complexities
        of a particular historical moment in South Africa. Goldblatt was drawn to the gold mines
        near his hometown, where he roamed as a child, and photographed these sites and the workers
        in black-and-white. In the 1990s he began to shoot in color to a greater extent, also
        including a few of his 1960s color photographs in his 2012 redesigned edition of <title
          render="italic">On the Mines</title>). </p>
      <p>Besides contributing to many photographic exhibitions, Goldblatt has published many books
        and has produced films created from his still images. He has been recognized for his
        achievements in documenting South African life and society with the Hasselblad Award in
        2006, the Cartier-Bresson Award in 2009, and the 2013 Lifetime Achievement Award from the
        International Center for Photography.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection comprises 251 silver bromide black-and-white photographic prints taken by David
        Goldblatt in South Africa during the late 1960s. Accompanying the photographs are also three
        16 mm films, <title type="simple" render="italic">Soweto</title>, <title type="simple"
          render="italic">On the Mines</title>, and <title type="simple" render="italic">Some
          Afrikaners</title>, created in 1976 from his still images; DVD viewing copies are
        available for these films. Goldblatt captured these images of gold miners and Afrikaaner
        people in different regions of South Africa, traveling from his hometown west of
        Johannesburg to the Western Cape province and the Karoo. </p>
      <p>The photographs in this collection were published in Goldblatt's first two books: <title
          type="simple" render="italic">On The Mines</title> (1973, with Nadine Gordimer) and <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Some Afrikaners Photographed</title> (1975). </p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">On the Mines</emph> series features images from the late 1960s of
        both white and black South African gold miners, in groups and individually, both inside and
        outside the mines. The images in the <emph render="bold">Some Afrikaners</emph> series, shot
        from 1961 to 1968, depict the everyday life of the white South Africans known as Afrikaners,
        and the environment in which they lived. Subjects include school, recreation, mealtimes,
        buildings, decorum and dress; there are group pictures as well as individual portraits. </p>
      <p>Print sizes vary: there are 8x10 inch prints; uncropped work prints of custom sizes and
        shapes on paper no larger than approximately 12 1/2 x 12 1/2 inches; and prints mounted on
        12 1/2 x 13 inch tan mat boards. Most have notes with printing instructions, with occasional
        captions on backs of prints or beneath prints on mat boards. Acquired as part of the Archive
        of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</p>
