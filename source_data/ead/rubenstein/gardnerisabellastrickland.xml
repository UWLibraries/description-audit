        "West of England Pocket Book or Gentleman's Diary with an almanack" presented to Isabella
        Gardner by her husband in 1852. Gardner filled the volume with routine diary entries,
        usually briefly mentioning the weather and the health of family members, whether they were
        any visitors, along with any travel or activities and with whom the family took tea or had
        dinner. More unusual entries have to do with a tooth extraction, the birth of Frank, and a
        fire at their home. Entries became less frequent from October to December 1853. Also,
        several pages list household accounts and amounts paid, usually for food and servant
        salaries. Several items post-dating the diary were laid-in, including four brief letters to
        and from family members, a recipe for a throat tonic, a note with dates of ancestors, and a
        religious flier. A child later made drawings in available spaces on pages of the
        diary.</abstract>
