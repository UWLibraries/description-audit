      <p>Charlotte Brontë was an English novelist and poet. She was born 1816 April 21 in Thornton,
        Yorkshire, and died 1855 March 31 in Haworth, Yorkshire. She wrote Jane Eyre and published
        it in 1847 under the pen name Currer Bell; her other pen names included Lord Charles Albert
        Florian, and Wellesley. She wrote her novella The Green Dwarf in 1833 but her first novel,
        The Professor, written before Jane Eyre, was only published in 1857. Her poetry was included
        in a volume of poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell in 1846. In 1839, she took up the
        first of many positions as governess to various families in Yorkshire, a career she pursued
        until 1841. She married Arthur Bell Nicholls in 1854, but died while pregnant with their
        first child.</p>
