        watercolor paintings by artchitect and amateur artist Amory Leland Williams, painted from
        1923 to 1939; and a group of etchings by various noted American artists, dating from 1921 to
        1957, collected by Williams. Most of the watercolors measure about 12x19 inches, and were
        painted in southern France and Italy, with a few from southern California and the American
        or Mexican desert. In Europe, Williams painted in brilliant scenes of Greek temples,
        churches, barns, canals, gardens, and monuments. The etchings are by notable American
        printmakers such as John Taylor Arms, Louis Rosenberg, and others. A handful are in their

      <p>Amory Leland Williams was born December 14, 1892 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. As a child and
        young adult he spent much of his time at the large Williams family residence in Vermont. He
        graduated from Williams College in 1914, then during World War I served as a 2nd Lieutenant
        in the 318th Engineers, Company A in France. He received a Masters degree in architecture
        from MIT in 1921. Subsequently he studied at the Academy in Rome for one year, 1921-1922. He
        was also an accomplished amateur watercolorist, and collected artwork. During his
        professional career he lived in Cleveland, Ohio and Los Angeles, California, among other
        places. He died on December 24, 1956, in Englewood, New Jersey, and is buried in Woodstock,
        Vermont, his final residence.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>Assembled by architect and artist Amory Leland Williams, this collection of 36 artworks is
        arranged in two series: watercolor drawings by Williams, painted from 1923 to 1939; and a
        group of etchings and one lithograph by various noted American artists, dating from 1921 to
        1957, collected by Williams. The prints range in size from 4 3/4 x 6 1/2 to 13 3/4 x 20
        inches, with most measuring roughly 12x19 inches.</p>
      <p>The watercolors are scenes from southern France (near Grasse) and Italy (Rome, Sicily,
        Stresa, Venice), probably painted during a trip in or before 1923; there are also some
        scenes from southern California and the American or Mexican desert, the latest of which is
        dated 1939. In Europe, Williams captured the brilliant colors of the Mediterranean, focusing
        on architectural details of Greek temples, churches, barns, canals, monuments, and
        fountains. Many pieces are signed, dated, and titled. One shows the Vittorio Emanuele
        monument in Rome under construction in 1923. Another, a small pastel caricature, is titled
        "Impression of the Kaiser" also from 1923.</p>
      <p>The 10 etchings and one lithograph are by notable American printmakers such as John Taylor
        Arms (2 prints, one of which is inscribed at length to Williams), Louis Rosenberg (3
        prints), and one each by Carl Schultheiss, Victoria Hutson Huntley, Richard Bishop, Warren
        Davis, and Don Sucuum. A handful are in their large original portfolios with an explanatory
        title sheet, as published by the Society of American Etchers, later known as the Society of
        American Graphic Artists (1952).</p>
