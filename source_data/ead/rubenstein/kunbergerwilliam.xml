        a resident of Philadephia at the time of the creation of these materials. Collection
        comprises a set of mailed postcards, correspondence, and photocopies of sources denying the
        Jewish Holocaust in Europe. Materials include letters to the recipients, photocopies of
        articles and books, and photocopies of primary evidence from post-war trials, statements,
        interviews, and aerial reconnaisance photographs used to support the denial of the
        Holocaust, in particular, the gassing of victims in European death camps. About half of the
        resource photocopies are in German. Also includes 39 typed postcards mailed by Kunberger to
        academics and other individuals from 2006-2008. Each postcard contains a segment of text;
        when put together, the cards form a lengthy statement, with citations and other texts,
        denying the Holocaust. Also included is one audiocassette recording entitled "11th Int'l
        Revisionist Conference Battle for Truth on the American Campus: A Jewish Revisionist's
        Perspective, Oct 92."</abstract>

      <head>Content Description</head>
      <p>Collection comprises a set of postcards, correspondence, and photocopies of sources,
        denying the Jewish Holocaust in Europe and offering various types of evidence for that
        belief. These materials were created and sent by William Kunberger to academics, writers,
        and others. Materials include typed letters to these individuals, and packets that include
        photocopies of Holocaust-related articles and books, and photocopies of primary evidence
        from post-war trials, statements, interviews, and aerial reconnaisance photographs. About
        half of the resource materials are in German. </p>
      <p>The collection also includes 39 typed postcards written by Kunberger and sent to academics
        and other individuals from 2006 to 2008. When put together in their chronological mailing
        order, the cards form a lengthy statement whose main argument is that buildings purported to
        be gas chambers for Jewish and other prisoners were actually air-raid shelters or morgues.
        Also included is one audiocassette entitled "11th Int'l Revisionist Conference / Battle for
        Truth on the American Campus: A Jewish Revisionist's Perspective, Oct 92." There are also
        two items about conflict in Guatemala and the killings of native inhabitants, 1981; these
        appear to be unrelated to the other materials.</p>

          <p>These blank mailing postcards were typed up and sent in a sequence over a period of two
            years by William Kunberger to various academics and other individuals. When pieced
            together in chronological order, the cards form a lengthy statement whose chief argument
            is that German gas chambers in reality served other purposes such as morgues and air
            raid shelters. The narrative includes citations from primary and secondary sources. </p>
          <p>The collection includes the original set, sent to Dr. Claudia Koontz at Duke
            University, as well as photocopies of the set, sent to others.</p>
