      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The collection consists of a bound manuscript volume entitled "Letters on Slavery, F.C.Y.,
        1853" (88 pages) and a small number of clippings, some loose and some mounted within the
        volume. The spine of the book, bookplate, and the copies of the letterse all bear Francis
        Yarnall's name or initials, so presumably the handwriting is his. It is possible the volume
        is a contemporary copy because all clippings date to 1861 or earlier.</p>
      <p>The volume has two parts: a wide-ranging discussion of slavery in the South (pages 1-25)
        and a series of letters (48 pages) dated 1853-1854 between Yarnall and Professor M. in New
        York, in which the discussion is continued. Yarnall toured the South and his initial article
        is dated March 1853 in Huntsville, Alabama. He wrote that he was opposed to slavery, but did
        not advocate sudden abolition. He was sensitive to the complexity of the subject, and
        presents a comprehensive assessment of many aspects of slavery: condition and treatment of
        slaves (both house and field hands); the character of black people; the character of
        overseers and masters; slave traders and drivers; agricultural practices in the South;
        treatment of runaway slaves, including the use of dogs and murder of fugitives; the impact
        of Northern anti-slavery movements; the reception of the Fugitive Slave Act; the prospects
        of colonization in Africa; and the relationship between Christianity and slavery. Yarnall
        appears to attempt a neutral view about these issues in his article, reiterating repeatedly
        that his comments are based on first-hand observations and inquiries.</p>
      <p>He is more hostile to slavery in the subsequent letters between himself and Professor M.
        Professor M. defended slavery on practical, religious, and philosophical grounds. Yarnall
        attacked slavery in his return letters. It is unclear whether Professor M. is an actual
        person or a literary device. All of the volume's letters are in the same handwriting.
        Additional topics include: the condition of blacks in Africa; labor in the North; inequality
        as a condition of life; white men's potential to elevate other races; prejudice between
        North and South; Jamaica's emancipation; the deaths of leaders Clay, Calhoun, and Webster;
        the Nebraska Bill; and Southern slavery laws.</p>
