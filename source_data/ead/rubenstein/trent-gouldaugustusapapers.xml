            tutor to the family of Mr. McBlair, a wealthy manufacturer of Jericho, Maryland, in
            long, detailed letters to his father, Nathaniel Duren Gould. In the earlier letters, he
            describes the trip from Boston, the roads and landscape, and presents a pencil drawing
            of the McBlair house and surrounding buildings. He writes of the day's routine, his
            teaching duties, and neighborhood news and gossip. He tells of how he listens for the
            mail wagon and of his disappointment with his pupils. His letters show that he did
            manage to keep up with events beyond Jericho, especially in the New England area. In his
            later letters, he professes a growing interest in medicine and botany. A much later
            letter informs William Jenks of his election as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts
            and Sciences.</abstract>
