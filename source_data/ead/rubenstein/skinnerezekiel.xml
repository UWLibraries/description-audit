         <abstract id="aspace_85cd3b7e17320cae05dbc01cd69b48b8">Ezekiel Skinner (1777-1855) was a
            missionary and physician who worked in Monrovia, Liberia for the American Colonization
            Society during the 1830s. Although almost 60 years old, Skinner believed it was his duty
            to continue the work of his son, Benjamin Rush Skinner, who had died in Liberia a few
            years before. He returned to the United States in 1837. This collection consists of 15
            letters and other related documents (with typed transcripts) written by Dr. Ezekiel
            Skinner during his time working for the American Colonization Society in Liberia.
            Skinner travelled to Africa twice beginning in 1834 and finally returning to the United
            States in 1837. These letters cover both trips and provide information about the
            day-to-day challenges faced by the emigrants from the United States. The majority of the
            letters are addressed to his family and written in the style of a journal, but there are
            also retained copies of Skinner's official correspondence as an officer of the Society.
            The contents of the letters touch upon various topics such as living conditions,
            missionary work, interaction with native Africans, and medical care of the
            emigrants.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Ezekiel Skinner (1777-1855) was a missionary and physician who studied medicine under
            Benjamin Rush in Philadelphia. During the time period covered by this collection,
            Skinner was in Monrovia, Liberia working for the American Colonization Society. His
            first trip to Africa in 1834 was inspired by the death of his son Benjamin Rush Skinner,
            who was serving as a minister in Monrovia when he succumbed to illness in 1831. Although
            almost 60 years old, Skinner believed it was his duty to continue the work of his son.
            During his second trip he was appointed as an agent of the United States government to
            oversee settlement of new Liberian citizens arriving from the United States. He returned
            to the United States in 1837.</p>
