            founded in New York, N.Y., in 1927; it developed the light-colored, transparent,
            filler-free Bakelite resin in a wide range of colors. Bakelite is the first synthetic
            plastic, developed by Dr. Leo Baekeland between 1907 and 1909. American Catalin
            Corporation used its form of the resin for costume jewelry, fashion accessories, radios,
            and other products. By 1942, the company suspended its manufacture of jewelry and cast
            items to concentrate on wartime production. After the war, petroleum-based plastics
            gained favor. Collection comprises a salesman's sample book in a black leather album
            used to provide a visual guide for the company's products. The album contains primarily
            34 black-and-white 8x10 photographs (8 photographs are laid in, all but two are linen
            backed, those not laid-in are stamped on the back with "Johnston &amp; Tunick Commercial
            Photographers"), as well as 17 typeset pages containing inter-office memos, sales tips,
            information regarding the company's competition, and customer testimonials. Several of
            the memos are written to the attention of D. J. Kelly, who was the salesman for whom the
            sample book was prepared. There is also a two-page key to the main group of 19
            photographs, identifying the Bakelite products in each photograph, as well as the item's
            final producer. Seven of the laid-in photographs show the corporation's factory,
            including three of factory workers on the job. The American Catalin Corporation was
