            pages) Sarah Ewing maintained in ink, focusing on the domestic abuse she suffered from
            her husband, including verbal and physical abuse. One entry also records her husband's
            arrest for an assault that took place outside the home. By the end of the diary, Sarah
            has left her husband in fear for her safety, taking with her the baby. After visiting
            the house in order to retrieve more clothing, she ends the diary with a note that she is
            not a thief, "I had never in my life before removed or taken away from H.H. [Haydon
            House] any articles of clothing or jewelry of any sort." Marginal notes made by an
            unidentified writer in pencil indicate that the diary may have been used in legal or
            other proceedings on her behalf.</abstract>
