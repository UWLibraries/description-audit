         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Walter Ireland Dawkins was a judge on the Supreme Bench of Baltimore from 1911 to 1934.
            He was born in Leonardtown, Maryland, on October 21, 1858, the son of Young Paran
            Dawkins, a St. Mary's County farmer, merchant, judge of the Orphans Court, and member of
            the Board of County Commissions. Walter Dawkins received a B.S. in 1880 and M.A. in 1883
            from St. John's College and practiced law briefly in St. Mary's County. He then moved to
            Chattanooga, Tennessee, and returned to Baltimore City in 1887. In Baltimore he built up
            a solid law practice and was on several occasions considered as a potential mayoral
            candidate. He was defeated in the Democractic primary in 1906 for a berth on the supreme
            bench, but was appointed to the bench in 1911 to fill a vacant term. Later that year he
            was elected to a fifteen year term and re-elected in 1926. In 1928, the state extended
            his term six years past the normal retirement age of seventy. He retired in 1934 and
            died two years later. Dawkins was active in numerous local organizations and served one
            term as President of the Maryland State Bar Association.</p>
         <p>He was a "confirmed bachelor," rarely recording interactions with women of any kind. The
            diary for 1920 shows that Dawkins had a live-in servant, "Ding", who, according to the
            U.S. Census for 1920, was a 32-year-old Japanese immigrant, formally named Dengi Hanno.

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Collection consists of ten manuscript diaries, octavo, comprising 3467 pages of entries,
            plus ephemeral items and over 80 newspaper clippings. Clippings have been removed when
            found to separate folders for preservation of the journals. The diaries are dated 1902,
            1903, 1905, 1920, 1921, 1922, 1926, 1929, 1930, and 1932. All are bound in their
            original cloth, of various colors. Four volumes have limp boards with normal wear to
            bindings. The entries are written in a neat hand, but one which requires some
            familiarity to read with ease.</p>
         <p>In his diaries, Dawkins typically recorded weather observations, followed by
            descriptions of his activities and his cases as an attorney (1903-1905) and on the bench
            (1920-1922, 1926, 1929-1930, and 1932). He also records the deaths of his colleagues,
            friends, and noted individuals of the day. After his quotidian entries denoting the
            weather and workaday activities, Dawkins makes note of his leisure pursuits, or comments
            on local and national political events. He mentions his attendance at events, both
            social and cultural. In his early diaries, he shows a penchant for taking Turkish baths
            on Saturday afternoons, followed by oysters and a night at the opera. The diaries
            document at least two trips abroad to Europe in 1905 and 1922, each trip lasting several
            months. There are also several domestic trips: one to Mackinaw Island, Michigan, in
            1921, and to the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone in 1926. Shorter vacations are also
            mentioned. The death of Dawkins' brother James is recounted on June 29, 1920. (James
            Dawkins was a former police magistrate and a member of the state legislature for
            Maryland.) The diary for 1929 also recounts the Stock Market Crash of that year.</p>
