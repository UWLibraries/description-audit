         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Louise Branscomb (1901-1999) was a gynecologist and surgeon from Birmingham, Alabama.
            She attended Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and opened her own practice in
            Birmingham in the 1930s. During World War II, she served as a major in the United States
            Public Health Service, and was stationed with the United Nations Relief and
            Rehabilitation Agency in Greece from 1944-1945. </p>
         <p>Following the war, she continued practicing medicine in Birmingham, and traveled
            throughout the world working in clinics and hospitals. Branscomb was also very active in
            the United Methodist Church, including the Methodist Board of Missions and the United
            Methodist Commission on the Status and Role of Women. She was named as one of one
            hundred outstanding United Methodist Women in 1986.</p>
         <p>Branscomb was born in 1901 to parents Lewis Capers and Minnie McGehee Branscomb, and was
            one of nine children in the Branscomb family. L.C. Branscomb was a pastor with
            appointments in several regional churches in and around Birmingham.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>This collection includes Dr. Louise Branscomb's diaries, notebooks, correspondence,
            photographs, and personal papers relating to her medical career and civic service in
            Birmingham during the twentieth century. There is also a significant amount of material
            related to the Branscomb family, including correspondence and clippings from Louise's
            parents and siblings.</p>
         <p>Dr. Branscomb's diaries and notebooks comprise the largest portion of the collection;
            they are held within the Bound Volumes Series. Her earliest diaries date from age
            thirteen, and continue off and on throughout her life. Along with personal diaries,
            Branscomb kept travel diaries documenting her various trips, including her World War II
            travels, Korea, China, India, Europe, Russia, Africa, and South America. Another notable
            portion of Volumes Series are Branscomb's medical notebooks, which she used as indices
            to assist her diagnoses and treatment of various illnesses. She also kept logs of her
            surgeries and baby deliveries. Along with Branscomb's diaries, the Volumes Series
            includes diaries and ledgers kept by her father, L.C. Branscomb, and her mother, Minnie
            Branscomb. L.C. Branscomb's notebooks log his sermons, baptisms, and travels, as well as
            his personal and family expenses.</p>
         <p>The Correspondence Series has been arranged in loose chronological order, with some
            isolated events foldered separately. This includes courtship letters between Louise
            Branscomb's parents, L.C. and Minnie, as well as condolences following L.C. Branscomb's
            accident and death in 1930. The majority of the series are incoming letters to the
            Branscomb family, with only a small number of letters written by Louise.</p>
         <p>The Family History Series is sorted by family member, including materials from Louise's
            parents, L.C. Branscomb and Minnie McGehee Branscomb, as well as some of her siblings:
            Harvie Branscomb, Richard Edwin Branscomb, Lamar Branscomb, Alline Branscomb, Emily
            Branscomb, Elizabeth Branscomb, Lewis Branscomb, as well as other relatives. The series
            also contains assorted ephemera collected by the family, including Confederate money and
            news clippings.</p>
         <p>Louise Branscomb's Personal Papers Series documents her range of activities, including
            her travels, her medical practice, her work with the United Methodist Church, and her
            philanthropy to institutions like Birmingham Southern College. The series includes
            drafts of her speeches and writings, as well as clippings referencing her and her work.
            Some clippings collected by Branscomb include her annotations or reflections on the
            subject or event, often dating from later in her life.</p>
         <p>The Photographs Series includes informal snapshots of the Branscomb family and their
            friends, as well as formal portraits of Louise Branscomb. This series also contains her
            various identification and membership cards.</p>
         <p>Finally, the Oral History Series contains four audio cassettes containing an oral
            history conducted between September and October of 1985 in Birmingham, Ala., when Martha
            E. King interviewed Dr. Branscomb on behalf of the Women's Division Oral History Project
            for the United Methodist Church's General Board of Global Ministries. There is also
            correspondence, biographical information about Dr. Branscomb, as well as detailed
            descriptions of and an index for the interview. However, no transcript of the interview
            is available. Interview topics include family, education, missionary work, women's
            issues in the church, race relations, and Branscomb's representing the church on her
            travels to Africa. </p>

                  and 8, 1985, in Birmingham, Alabama. The interviews were part of the Women's
                  Division Oral History Project. It was decided prior to the interviews that the
                  focus would be limited to Branscomb's experiences in the Wesleyan Service Guild,
                  the Women's Division, and the Board of Missions of the United Methodist Church, as
                  it was believed her diaries and papers at Duke would illuminate the rest of her

                  <p>"Tape 1 side 1. Explanation for filing her diaries which were kept in much
                     detail. This interview is limited to her experinces with Guild, Women's
                     Division and activities in the United Methodist Church. Family information: A
                     church member from age 6, she attended regularly and was active in Epworth
                     League. Account of a special religious experience. Brother Meanss was pastor
                     and its interpretation by a professor later. Active in Sunday School and
                     Missionary Society for children; reference to medical school and subsequent
                     establishing her medical practice; local guild responsibility; difficulty with
                     terminology of Guild, since it could not name a president; importance of Guild
                     in her life. A concern for the timing of the Program Book's release resulted in
                     a personal conference with Lillian Johnson. Soon thereafter Louise was invited
                     to serve on Wesleyan Service Guild Committee and chair Com. on Missionary
                     Education. Her response led to 8 years on Guild Com. and 8 more on Board of
                     Missions. In 1956 the Guild Com. was chaired by a member of Women's Division
                     who was not a Guild member. Effects of meeting at Buck Hill Falls and an
                     interesting attempt to have a simpler style of food service.</p>
                  <p>Tape 1 side 2. Evaluation of Buck Hill Falls as a meeting place; interesting
                     persons attending; difficulty in being present for full time as a professional
                     person and the impatience the Division had for those who were not. Louise
                     pleaded for meeting to be more convenient for working women to participate.
                     Discussion on what the Black members of the Board preferred to be called.
                     Incident of a roommate who snored and a comment on God-language. Martha's story
                     of a young woman who attended the National Student Convocation. Role of Women's
                     Society and Guild in educating women in race relations. Difficulties in
                     relationships of Guild and WSCS since Guild was considered merely a committee,
                     with limited meeting time; request for a promotion fund for the Guild Com.
                     Guild membership in the Southeast was made up mostly of teachers and
                     secretaries. Louise Branscomb was the only person in leadership trained in
                     medicine and science. Reasons the Guild was attractive to Louise, the role of
                     Lillian Johnson and others. Louise's attempts to organize Guilds in two textile
                     industry towns; lack of understanding of the difference in a night circle and a
                     Guild."</p>

                  <p>From interview worksheet:</p>
                  <p>"Tape 2 Side 1, September 14, 1985 and October 7, 1985. Relationship of
                     parent-child when a Society organized a Guild. Survey used with employed women
                     to determine their needs and goals. Explanation of how Louise went directly
                     from local to Wesleyan Service Guild Committee (National) and resulting
                     resentment that she had not gone 'through channels." The Guild flourished
                     partly because the times were right for women to organize. Of utmost importance
                     to Louise was the cooperation of Guild and Society and, ideally, the the total
                     church, the cooperation of men and women. She feels the Women's Division has
                     been able to keep its identity, largely due to its income. Concern about
                     apartheid in South Africa in 1967 resulted in a proposal to challenge banking
                     practice. Compromise effected -- but 18 years later this is still an issue.
                     Tension between Women's Society and Guild but the reason it worked was that
                     church women made it work. Example of tension is shown in the history of North
                     Alabama women which devotes only 2 of the 127 pages to the guild. Values of
                     service on the Board of Missions to Louise. Her attempt to place two Guild
                     members on the Board was defeated. Louise was named to represent the Board at
                     the Geneva Conference on 'The Future of Man in a World of Science-Based
                     Technology.' Scientists, theologians and public servants attended and the
                     scientists seemed to be the authority. Only three women were in attendance
                     among the one hundred persons participating.</p>
                  <p>Tape 2, Side 2, October 7, 1985. Conference had simulataneous translation. Her
                     experience with Harvey Cox and participation in the communion service. Also,
                     reaction to Margaret Meade. Louise's rebuttal to Dr. Hakm's stance that the
                     women's movement was unnecessary. Dr. Warwick Kern of Sao Paulo spoke frankly
                     on political torture and charged that the oppressors were trained by people
                     from United States and financed by Porte Este. This distressed Louise. It
                     seemed to Louise that the scientists were the particpants who were looking
                     ahead and declaring that science, religion and government need to help each
                     other. Reference to Eric Frohm's "Art of Loving" and Louise's conclusion on its
                     popularity. Louise finds too many areas today which are too highly specialized.
                     Reference to participation recently in a seminar at Vanderbilt University on
                     'The Professions and Ethics.' She explains that she finds it difficult to share
                     the experience of a conference or seminar with others. Following the Geneva
                     Conference, Louise visited in the home of Bishop Schaefer. An account of dinner
                     with his family and the practice of discussing the events of the day together.
                     She feels that abolishing the office on 'Status of Women' in the Women's
                     Society was a mistake. With the formation of the Commission on the Status and
                     Role of Women the responsibilities were transferred from Society to Commission.
                     The latter had a three-fold function: advocacy, monitoring, and catalyst.
                     Louise feels that the function of education was lost as the Commission did not
                     have a network. She views as very important the joint effort of the Women's
                     Division and the Commission on Status and Role of Women to prepare women for
                     participation in General Conference. Her observation is that the local woman
                     does not understand the work of supportive community as it deals with the
                     'status and role' function."</p>

                  <p>From interview worksheet:</p>
                  <p>"Tape 3 Side 1, October 7, 1985. Louise was a participant in the Consultation
                     in Africa in 1968, which emphasized Rhodesia. She relates an experience with
                     Mildred Taylor, a missionary, and gives her first-hand observation of the rigid
                     rules on separation of the races. Louise's realization that we think so
                     differently from South Africans. Another missionary, Lorena Kelley, was
                     Louise's rommate at the consultation and she was very helpful. The purpose of
                     the consultation was two fold: (1) to listen to what the African said and (2)
                     to help them understand what the Mission Board is doing and why. Incident she
                     observed of a man's going through the garbage pails and finding only a small
                     bit of banana left in its peel. Bishop Shunga and his district superintendents
                     were present for the consultation. She felt that some of the requests made were
                     unreasonable; e.g. request for a new Toyota to replace on which a district
                     superintendent had driven into a stream and left. Louise felt that Bishop
                     Shunga launched a verbal attack on her when she asked the group to tell her
                     what they wanted. Then, the bishop requested (more nearly ordered) her to lead
                     the devotional the next morning. Relunctantly she agreed and decided to use the
                     topic 'What It Means to Me to Be a Christian.' After the consultation she felt
                     that had not accomplished much but then realized that she had learned a great
                     deal. Staff members were more optimistic of the outcome of the consultation.
                     Reference to Maya Angelou's 'Heart of a Woman,' with emphasis on the 'palaver'
                     over her situation. She concluded that she had failed to recognize the fact
                     that the husband should made the decision rather than the wife. They
                     recommended that she give the husband another chance. The Bishop concluded that
                     the palaver plan called for too much talk and he had decided to do most of the
                     talking himself. October 8, 1985. Louise was elected to the Board in 1964 and
                     found her previous experience valuable. She was intensely interested in finding
                     younger women to serve. Being named to the Board Executive Committee, she found
                     herself in a new situation -- that of interpreting the position of the Women's
                     Division on matters. The men treated her as a peer. She recounts appearing
                     before the Council of Bishops in Nashville to relate the work of the Commission
                     on Status and Role of Women.</p>
                  <p>Tape 3 Side 2, October 8, 1985. Louise felt good about the presentation and
                     related that when the bishops reconvened they sang 'Rise Up, O Men of God.' She
                     observed that humor is often a signal for the beginning of understanding. She
                     cited Birmingham, Alabama, as a good example of cooperation among its citizens.
                     She referred to the unrest among the Black persons on the Board of Missions and
                     their attempt to speak to the Board. The youth on the Board invited Board
                     members to a caucus and Louise was the only member to respond except the two
                     Board Members assigned to the Youth. Following a confrontation with one of the
                     young women Louise was better able to understand the attitude of the youth.
                     Subsequently Louise was able to get the bishops to hear the youth in the
                     plenary. In 1984 Louise was a delegate to the General Conference; previously
                     she had been an alternate and had attended quite a number of conferences. At
                     the Portland General Conference she gave the minority report on 'Term
                     Episcopacy.' She had assistance especially from Augusta Carruth and Nan Self.
                     Her own conference was very supportive of her as a person, although they did
                     not agree with her report and its position. She believes that the ecumenical
                     movement will bring term episcopacy. She reviewed her report to the Atlanta
                     General Conference on 'abortion' in which she used reference to Albert
                     Schweitzer's philosophy, 'reverence for life.' She stressed the need to
                     consider quality of life for those affected in making the decision. She
                     concludes from this experience 'It's all right to make a fool of yourself for
                     Jesus.' Louise Branscomb has given 28 consecutive years on committees,
                     agencies, commissions and/or Boards of the larger church. During these years
                     she emphasized that women must be brought into the mainstream of both church
                     and society. One group met in Chicago to discuss 'Status of Women' and a
                     petition to the General Conference did set up a Study Committee but a proposal
                     from the floor bo bypass the Study Committee report and go ahead and set up a
                     working commission was made -- it passed. A technique which Louise finds useful
                     is that of pretending she has come to Earth from Mars and she questions if what
                     is being done makes any sense. She repeated her concern that United Methodist
                     Women no longer has a leader to work with Status of Women. Another concern is
                     for clergy women. She made an analogy of her own experience in thinking
                     initially that she had to set up her medical practice in the same manner as did
                     male physicians."</p>

                  <p>From the interview worksheet:</p>
                  <p>"Tape 4 Side 1, October 8, 1985. She wants to help clergy women avoid the
                     hierarchy existing among male clergy. Also she has watched with interest the
                     Commission's use of the secretariat style and the use of consensus. Among her
                     learnings are: She has learned 'to trust the process'; she trusts the
                     relationship of the Women's Division and the Status and Role Commission;
                     techniques and experiences have carry-over value into secular activities. There
                     were difficult times in first quadrennium of Commission on Status and Role of
                     Women. She appreciated the statement of Bishop DeWitt as he transferred to
                     another assignment. An important activity was the Convocation for Clergy Women.
                     Louise saw a need for laity to also be trained. A major learning for Louise
                     centered on methods of bringing up a matter in varying arenas. With reference
                     to her stay in India at one of the hospitals, she feels she received more than
                     she could ever give. She explains that being 'Christian' is also being a
                     liberal, with 'liberal' defined as willing to change. In closing she shared an
                     anecdote from one trip to California in which she found a good slacks suit --
                     in fact, the first one she had ever bought. Bishop Goodson admired the suit and
                     wanted one just like it for his wife."</p>
