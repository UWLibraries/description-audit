      <abstract id="aspace_e5eba7b87e7a3fb52fdd2846fc367aa4">Collection consists of a single letter
        from the Pre-Raphealite poet Christina Rossetti to an unnamed recipient in the publishing
        industry. She grants him permission to use poems from three of her published collections in
        an upcoming "Fine Art Book for Christmas 1882." Rossetti states that there should be no
        variation of the text from the source material, and that she chose those three collections
        because she personally holds their copyright. </abstract>

      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Christina Rossetti was an English Victorian poet associated with the Pre-Raphealite
        movement that was founded by her brother, Dante Gabriel. All three of Rossetti's siblings
        were also writers. Her style is in the Romantic tradition of Elizabeth Barrett Browning.
        Rossetti's collections of poetry referenced in this letter, "Sing Song: A Nursery Rhyme
        Book" and "Pageant and Other Poems" were published in 1872 and 1881, respectively.
        Rossetti's poem, "In the Bleak Midwinter" became widely known after it was set to music and
        sung as a Christmas carol. Recent scholarship has examined feminist themes in Rossetti's
        work</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection consists of an autograph manuscript letter signed Christina G. Rossetti,
        granting the unnamed recipient, presumably a publisher, permission to reprint some of her
        poems. The letter is written on a single folded sheet of paper with text on two pages. She
        lists her address as: 30 Torrington Square - London - W.C. Rossetti refers to the
        correspondent's "assurance that no variation whatsoever" will appear in "your Fine Art book
        for Xmas 1882." Rossetti names three of her books he may use as source material: "Poems,"
        "Pageant," and "Sing Song." She writes, "I name these, because not every piece to be found
        elsewhere is in every instance of my own copyright."</p>
