      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Writing desk at which one would stand, designed and owned by Virginia Woolf. The sloping
        top of the desk features a central panel in two pieces, with hinges at the top. The panel
        lifts to reveal a storage compartment underneath.Two drawers are located below the storage
        area, one on each side of the desk. There are metal pulls on each drawer. The left-hand
        drawer pull surrounds a flower medalion; the medalion on the right-hand drawer is missing.
        The drawers and desk top each feature a metal lock, but no keys are present. Quentin Bell
        painted the figure of Cleo holding a trumpet on the top of the desk. He painted the rest of
        the desk, except the back, in grays with black accents. There are random spatters of paint

      <head>Custodial History</head>
      <p>The desk was designed and ordered by Virginia Woolf between 1904 and 1907 and moved first
        to Asheham, then to Monks House at Rodmell. In 1929, she offered the desk to her nephew,
        Quentin Bell, who took it to Charleston, the home of his parents, Vanessa and Clive Bell.
        Bell painted the figure of Cleo holding a trumpet on the top of the desk at that time. At
        some later date, his wife, Olivier Bell, shortened the desk's legs by six inches. They sold
        the desk in a Sotheby sale to aid Charleston in 1980.</p>
