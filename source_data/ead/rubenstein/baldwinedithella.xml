            Worcester, Massachusetts. Collection consists of 39 unpublished volumes of stories,
            novels, poetry, lecture notes, and family history from Edith Ella Baldwin, including a
            novel about sex education for women, diary excerpts describing her visits with painter
            Mary Cassatt, and typescript copies of letters from her aunt, Ellen Frances Baldwin,
            dating from 1848 to 1854. Edith Baldwin's writings tend to cover timeless themes of
            religion and love, although some compositions include contemporary issues such as
            automobiles, labor strikes, and women's rights. Each volume is arts-and-crafts style
            construction with typed texts, frequently annotated by hand.</abstract>

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>Edith Ella Baldwin was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, on November 19, 1870 to Ellen
            L. T. Peckham and Charles Clinton Baldwin, the son of Reverend John Denison Baldwin. She
            was baptized at All Saint's Church in Worcester in November 1888. She was an artist who
            produced paintings and miniatures, as well as a craftswoman and bookbinder. Her entry in
               <title type="simple" render="italic">Representative Women of New England</title> says
            she studied at the Julian Academy in Paris and exhibited at the Salon of the Champ de
            Mars in 1901, and in Worcester in 1903. She died on February 21, 1940.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection and its volumes represent over 20 years of work by Edith Ella Baldwin.
            There is no indication that any of her writings were published, although rejection
            letters included in one of the volumes suggests that she did attempt to become published
            at one point.</p>
         <p>Each volume consists of typescript or carbon copy pages, sewn into cloth boards with
            dyed red cloth covers stamped with gold lettering; two volumes are burlap and one is
            corduroy. Some of the volumes' bindings are loose or separated from their covers. The
            texts have been copy-edited with corrections throughout, along with several re-titled in
            pencil. Most volumes' title pages include notes explaining whether the work is a
            fragment, unfinished, or complete; how they "must not be changed"; and how many are "the
            only copy in existence." Several stories also include Baldwin's handwritten
            introduction, summarizing the action or presenting the theme.</p>
         <p>Many of the stories explore love and religion, but several are noteworthy for their
            contemporary subjects. "The Automobile" is a short story written in 1907 following two
            women as they tour New England in their Pope Hartford automobile. "Antony the
            Foreigner," an unpublished 1912 novel, concerns anarchists, labor strikes, worker
            unrest, and the suspicion of foreigners. The most notable text is the 1911 "Affairs at
            Farslope," a 140-page novella about a women's refuge for troubled young girls and how
            proper sex education could have prevented their misfortune.</p>
         <p>Along with Baldwin's fiction and poetry, the collection includes lecture notes from
            several courses she took on bookbinding, cooking, nursing, and art. There are also her
            efforts at preserving her family's history, including a copy of her aunt's diary, dated
            1848-1854; several of her grandfather's sermons; a volume of stories and poems by her
            younger sister, who died at age 11; and selected excerpts of her own journal kept while
            studying art in Paris from 1889-1892.</p>
         <p>The materials have been arranged by genre, with the Fiction and Poetry Series making up
            the bulk of the collection; the Non-Fiction Series consisting largely of lecture notes
            and diary entries; and the Family History Series, which includes her aunt's diary, other
            family writings, and sermons. Within each series, materials have been arranged
            chronologically.</p>

                  <p>140 pp. A fictional account arguing for better information and openness about
                     sex education. The story revolves around a women's refuge for troubled young
                     girls, with talk of suffragettes, and one young girl seduced by a man afflicted
                     with "the unmentionable disease" causing her child to be born blind. "Girls
                     surely had a right to protection. Romance was all very well where a world was
                     righteous and men saints, but the world was in spots as bad or worse than it
                     had been; yes, worse perhaps, for the innocent suffered for wrong they had
                     never committed, and the wicked escape and flourishes. ... The modern way of
                     the nineteenth century which had dwelt upon the spirit was only a half truth.
                     Things had been taught that flesh and spirit were at war, and everything that
                     went with flesh was shameful and wicked. Lust, gluttony, etc. were wrong, of
                     course.... But to teach that hunger, thirst, and other things were wicked in
                     themselves was cowardly." An unpublished novel that sheds insight into women's
                     views on sex at the turn of the century.</p>

                  <p>Cover title: A Talk of Paris Art Days. 56 pp. Excerpts from letters written by
                     Baldwin and her sister while both were studying abroad in 1889-1892. They
                     describe attending Academie Julian in Paris in great detail, including their
                     classes, instructors, fellow students, and city life. They also comment on the
                     1889 World's Fair, seeing Sandra Bernhardt's performance as Cleopatra, and
                     having dinner with their aunt's friend, impressionist painter Mary Cassatt.
                     Baldwin describes one evening, "We dined with the Cassatt's last Sunday evening
                     ... Miss Cassatt and her mother talked incessantly and very interestingly. Old
                     pa Cassatt, beside whom I was placed at dinner, was very gallant, but
                     distressed because he was so exceedingly deaf... I think if I had to listen to
                     them continually I should wish to become deaf, like pa Cassatt." Her sister
                     adds that Cassatt was "an exceedingly clever woman, although a little
                     eccentric. Her mother is a bright little old lady of seventy six and both
                     mother and daughter say just the same thing in just the same voice and the
                     effect is a little unusual."</p>
