        gunroom of the HMS Leviathan, a Royal navy cruiser based in the China Station in 1903. Diary
        of life aboard a British war ship, maintained by M. F. Wilson over one year, including
        entries related to target practice and other drills, preparation of torpedos, coaling,
        mooring and unmooring, movements of sailors among the Royal Navy's ships, watches and
        duties, cleaning and painting, preparations for inspection, and the coming and going of
        other countries' vessels. He also records activities during free time, including playing
        football, hockey, rugby, cricket and taking part in boxing matches and hunting parties.
        Wilson outlines his shore leave excursions to Mato, China; Tokyo; Shanghai; and the Ming
        Tombs, where he attended dinners and the theater, bathed and swam, or held picnics and
        hiked. There are descriptions of hotels, bath houses, tea rooms and stores. In an entry for
        December 12, Wilson notes the purchase of his photographic gear, and in February he
        announces that war has been declared between Japan and Russia, the progress of which he
        follows in subsequent entries. Major ports mentioned include Nagasaki, Weihaiwei, China;
        Hong Kong, Yokohama, Woosung, and Nankin. </abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Diary of life aboard a British war ship, maintained by M. F. Wilson over one year,
        including entries related to target practice and other drills, preparation of torpedos,
        coaling, mooring and unmooring, movements of sailors among the Royal Navy's ships, watches
        and duties, cleaning and painting, preparations for inspection, and the coming and going of
        other countries' vessels. He also records activities during free time, including playing
        football, hockey, rugby, cricket and taking part in boxing matches and hunting parties.
        Wilson outlines his shore leave excursions to Mato, China; Tokyo; Shanghai; and the Ming
        Tombs, where he attended dinners and the theater, bathed and swam, or held picnics and
        hiked. There are descriptions of hotels, bath houses, tea rooms and stores. In an entry for
        December 12, Wilson notes the purchase of his photographic gear, and in February he
        announces that war has been declared between Japan and Russia, the progress of which he
        follows in subsequent entries. Major ports mentioned include Nagasaki, Weihaiwei, China;
        Hong Kong, Yokohama, Woosung, and Nankin. </p>
      <p>There are 64 albumen and silver gelatin photographs, probably all taken by Wilson. Includes
        panoramas of Hong Kong, Yokohama, and Weihaiwei harbors; as well as photographs of his
        fellow midshipmen; steam boats used for transport; images of the Leviathan; docking and
        drydock areas; coaling; along with picnics, hikes, hunting parties, and street scenes from
        his shore leave, particularly in Mato, Weihaiwei, Shanghai, and the Ming tombs. There are
        also images related to target practice for the ship and two images of Japanese ships
        destroyed by the Russians during the Russo-Japanese war. </p>
      <p>There are 19 ink drawings, including one map. Subjects include landscapes, sunken vessels,
        Leviathan target practice, and other incidental images.</p>
