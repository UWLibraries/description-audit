        activists, actions and activities of the Women's Social and Political Union between 1908 and
        1917. The unidentified compiler was likely a member of the organization, for she included
        handwritten labels identifying unnamed participants and often provided handwritten
        commentary on actions taken or the treatment of women imprisoned. In several cases, she was
        also able to obtain autographs of individual suffragists. Events documented include the 1913
        Suffrage Pilgrimage, the memorial for Emily Wilding Davison, Rosa May Billinghurst, the
        Coronation procession, and the suffragist's bombing of Westminster Abbey. Other topics
        include what men did to get the vote; voting as a right; forcible feedings and other
        injuries the women sustained; marches, speeches, and gatherings of support; the work of the
        Pankhursts; women's activities in support of the war in Europe; the organization's offices;

      <head>Biographical note</head>
      <p>The Women’s Social and Political Union (W.S.P.U.) was the leading militant organization
        campaigning for women's suffrage in the United Kingdom, 1903–1917, and was a breakaway
        organization from the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. Its membership and
        policies were tightly controlled by Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters, Christabel and
        Sylvia. It was best known for hunger strikes (resulting in forced feedings), for breaking
        windows in prominent buildings, and for night-time arson of unoccupied houses and
        churches.</p>
