      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The majority of this collection consists of letters received by Samuel Wilberforce while he
        served as Bishop of Oxford, and tend to relate to missionary activities of the Church of
        England in East Africa and various British colonies in the mid-nineteenth century. Letters
        from the 1830s document Wilberforce’s role in coordinating the Society for Propagation of
        the Gospel with the Church Missionary Society. Additional correspondence from 1857 through
        1864 describes other Anglican Church missions and clergy in Sarawak (Malaysia), Tasmania,
        New Zealand, and the West Indies. Notable correspondents include Sir James Brooke, Rajah of
        Sarawak (whose memorandum dates from Apr. 2, 1860) and Sir Samuel White, whose letter from
        1869 describes his expedition on the White Nile in Egypt and Sudan.</p>
      <p>East Africa is the subject of several letters to Wilberforce between 1853 and 1863. Two
        letters from John William Colenso, Bishop of Natal, discuss the status of the Anglican
        Church in Natal, his attempts to acquire financial aid, the refusal of the Society for the
        Propagation of the Gospel to provide aid for white residents, difficulties between Natal’s
        governor and his council, and injustices to the Kaffirs. A letter (dated Aug. 23, 1860) from
        Christopher Palmer Rigby, British veteran officer, describes economic and social conditions
        of Zanzibar, including the extent of the slave trade there and French activities on the
        island. Rigby also writes about the depopulation of the African coast due to slave
        expeditions, British naval actions against slavers, and recent ventures into the African
        interior. A batch of ten letters from Charles Frederick Mackenzie, Bishop of Central Africa,
        date between 1859 and 1861. Mackenzie’s letters describe the preparations for his trip to
        the Shire River region, his consecration of the mission in Cape Town, South Africa, and his
        work and discussions with Daniel Livingstone, who assisted in founding the mission in
        Nyasaland (Malawi). He describes their journey to the mission site, including Livingstone’s
        freeing of slaves they encountered being transported to markets, and also writes about
        relations between the local Manganja and Ajawa tribes.</p>
      <p>The collection also includes contemporary copies of letters describing David Livingstone’s
        activities in the Zambezi River area, including a letter from Mar. 15, 1862, which describes
        Mackenzie’s destruction of a hostile village and his death from fever and dysentery. A
        related letter (unsigned) from Apr. 27, 1862, describes Mackenzie’s activities in the Shire
        region, as well as the political landscape between various tribes and the role of slave
        traders in fermenting war between various groups. A letter from Feb. 2, 1863, from British
        Foreign Secretary Lord John Russell informs Wilberforce that Livingstone’s expedition has
        been withdrawn from the mission.</p>
