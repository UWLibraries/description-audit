         <head>Collection Description</head>
         <p>In 1890 Congress appropriated funds for the surveying and improvement of the Columbia
            River in Washington state, including $10,000 for surveying the river from the
            international boundary line southward to Rock Island Rapids. In 1891 the U.S. Army Corps
            of Engineers made this survey as far south as the Okanogan River. William Cuthbert led
            the team that made the survey. His superior was Capt. Thomas W. Symons of the U.S.
            Engineer office at Portland, Oregon. Their reports upon the 1891 survey were published
            as part of the annual report in 1893 of the Chief of Engineers, U.S. Army, which is in
            the <title type="simple" render="italic">Report of the Secretary of War...</title>
            (Washington, 1893), Vol. II, Pt. 4, pp. 3381-3399. Copies of the reports by Symons and
            Cuthbert are filed in the Information Folder of this collection.</p>
         <p>Two albums contain 74 photographs (7 1/4 x 9 in.), albumen prints, from the survey of
            1891 These photographs are numbered, and their numbers and content correspond to those
            of photographs listed in Capt. Symons' report. Sixteen of the pictures are duplicated,
            so there are actually 57 different scenes. The scenes are along the Columbia River in
            Ferry and Stevens counties in northeastern Washington from the Canadian border southward
            88 miles to Elbow Bend 17 miles north of the mouth of the Spokane River. Capt. Symons
            wrote that <emph render="doublequote">a large number of photographs was taken of the
               river and its vicinity,</emph> and he sent with his report a set <emph
               render="doublequote">of those which most clearly illustrate the river, especially at
               the bad places.</emph> Most of the Photographs in these albums are views of parts of
            the river where there were problems for navigation. The photographs are of the following
            areas: the Canadian boundary, Murphy's Rapid, Sheep Creek Bend, Onion Creek, Little
            Dalles, Marble Mountain, Nine-mile Rapids, rapid above Marcus, Big Bend above Marcus,
            mouth of Kettle River, Kettle Falls, Grand Rapids, Rock Islands, Gifford's Rapid, Turtle
            Rapid, and Elbow Bend. The large number of photographs from the survey of 1891 included
            scenes further down the river as far as the mouth of the Okanogan River and perhaps
            others from the stretch of the Columbia River represented by the photographs in these
            two albums.</p>
         <p>The photographs were made from glass plate negatives. They were numbered, but the
            numbers are not always visible on the prints in the albums. The numbers written in ink
            on the corners of the mounting boards in Album II are the photograph numbers. They
            should not be confused with later numbers written with a pencil which are merely name
            numbers. The numbers written with a blue pencil on the boards in Album I are the
            photograph numbers.</p>
         <p>The photographs show the usual deterioration, but many of them retain rich brown tones.
            Among the 16 scenes for which there are two prints, In many cases one print is in better
            condition than its duplicate. These photographs are mostly scenery devoid of people and
            buildings, but there are a few exceptions, notably the structures at Little Dalles,
            Indian Ferry nearby, and on Hayes Island at Kettle Falls. The latter is only a distant
            view, but there are fine pictures of the tiny settlements at Little Dalles and Indian
            Ferry (Nos. 18, 20, 25).</p>
         <p>The name of the photographer is not in the albums, and it was not given in the reports
            by Symons and Cuthbert. The albums probably belonged to the photographer or to someone
            on the survey, because there are notations on the reverse of the last board in Album II
            that strongly suggest that relationship. There is a list of numbers with the following
            notation: <emph render="doublequote">The following negatives to be duplicated so that
               original one can be sent to Chicago.</emph>
