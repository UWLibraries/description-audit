        album likely created by an African American soldier serving in Vietnam. There are 268
        uncaptioned black-and-white and several color photographs ranging in size from 2 3/4 x 3 1/2
        to 3 1/2 x 5 inches, along with 15 souvenir postcards. Images primarily feature informal
        shots of African American and white servicemen in camp and off base, though few show the
        races mingling. There is also a series of well-executed portraits of individual soldiers,
        white and black. The photographer took many images of U.S. Army camps and air bases, army
        personnel and vehicles, street scenes from Saigon and smaller villages, and took numerous
        snapshots of local citizens, chiefly women and children. There are a handful of shots
        showing bombing raids and cleared or destroyed jungle areas. Overall, the images offer a
        wealth of details about the Vietnam War from a variety of viewpoints. Acquired as part of
        the John Hope Franklin Research Center for African and African American History and
        Culture.</abstract>

      <head>Content Description</head>
      <p>Collection comprises a photograph album likely created by an unidentified African American
        soldier serving in Vietnam. There are 268 uncaptioned black-and-white and several color
        photographs ranging in size from 2 3/4 x 3 1/2 to 3 1/2 x 5 inches, along with 15 souvenir
        postcards, all carefully arranged and mounted in a large decorative travel scrapbook. </p>
      <p>Images primarily feature off-duty African American and white servicemen in camp and off
        base, although few show white and black soldiers mingling. There is also a series of
        well-executed portraits of individual soldiers, white and black. Scenes from the streets of
        Saigon and perhaps other large cities abound, showing the diversity of vehicles and
        pedestrians; there are also some taken in smaller, unidentified towns and villages,
        presumably in Vietnam. The photographer took many images of markets, bars, pharmacies, and
        other buildings, almost always from the exteriors, as well as numerous snapshots of local
        citizens, chiefly women and children, often in groups, and some who appear to be frequently
        associated with the U.S. military base or camp.</p>
      <p>Military locations and scenes include an air base, helicopters in flight, a crashed
        helicopter, military bases and personnel, Army vehicles along the roads, military police
        (including one African American), and what appear to be checkpoints. There are a handful of
        shots showing bombing raids and cleared or destroyed jungle areas. </p>
      <p>Overall, the images in this photograph album offer a wealth of details about the Vietnam
        War from a variety of viewpoints.</p>
      <p>Acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin Research Center for African and African American
        History and Culture.</p>
