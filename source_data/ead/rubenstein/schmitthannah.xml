         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Collection comprises a cloth-bound photograph album maintained by Schmitt when she
            attended Camp Michigamme, beginning in 1920. The album contains 243 black-and-white
            photographs, most measuring 4x2.5 inches. Images document camp life, and show Hannah and
            other young women living in tents, canoeing, swimming, playing sports, cleaning,
            entertaining themselves, reading and relaxing. Places visited mentioned are Baldy,
            Pequaming, Sand Island, and Flat Island. Almost all of the images have captions written
            by Schmitt; several of them were later inked in color. There is also a photograph of the
            Hebard's Mill at Pequaming, Michigan, the mill that Ford Motor Company purchased in
            1923. Photographs on several pages in the back of the album are of Schmitt family
            members, and were taken outside of the camp. A number of the images were developed by a
            Michigan company named "Forster's-Calumet." In addition to the photographs, the album
            contains some manuscript items, including notes, poetry, a Western Union Telegram
            (regarding Schmitt's relationship with a West Point Cadet), along with a 7-page story
            that represents each camper and staff member as clouds at dawn.</p>
