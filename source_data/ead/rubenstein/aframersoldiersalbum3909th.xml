        black-and-white snapshots and one photographic postcard. The photographs document a
        close-knit group of African American soldiers of the U.S. Army's 3909th Quartermaster Truck
        Company in Munich, Germany, August 1945, during the last weeks of World War II. The
        snapshots are of individuals and groups in uniform, in casual settings; scenes include the
        men standing in line at mealtime, enjoying leisure time in what appears to be an
        un-segregated pool facility, posing with Army trucks, and standing in front of a bombed-out
        building in Munich. Most have handwritten captions with last names, nicknames, and some
        comments. Acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin Research Center of African and African
        American History at Duke University.</abstract>

      <head>Content Description</head>
      <p>Small photograph album (6x8 inches) housing 35 loosely mounted photographs of U.S. Army
        African American soldiers in Munich, Germany, August 1945. Comprises 34 black-and-white
        snapshots measuring approximately 2 1/2 x 3 3/4 inches, and one black-and-white photographic
        postcard portrait (3x5 inches) of a Corporal Jack Taylor, to whom the album may have
        belonged. The caption on the back of the postcard bears the name of the 3909th Quartermaster
        Truck Company. The only dates in the album are found on one page and refer to August
        16-19th, 1945, but the other photographs may have been taken before or after this
        period.</p>
      <p>The snapshots are of individuals and groups, and chiefly show the men enjoying some leisure
        time during the last months of World War II. Most of the images have handwritten captions
        with last names, nicknames, and commentary. Scenes include the men posing in their bathing
        suits in what appears to be an un-segregated pool facility, posing with Army trucks,
        standing in front of a bombed-out building (the only city scene), and waiting in line at
        mealtime. Among the last names are: Sergeant Carney, Sergeant Riley, Sergeant Ousley,
        "McKnight," Louis Allen, Sergeant Edward Johnson and Private Robert Johnson ("the fat
        boys"), First Sergeant Brown, "Mule" Crawford, Homer Magee, "Blind" Knight, J. Martin,
        Jenkins ("the jive man from New Jersey"), and Corporal Jack Taylor. </p>

      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>The African American soldiers in this album are shown in Munich, Germany, during the last
        months of World War II. The importance of the Army's Truck Companies to which they belonged
        has been well documented. These convoys, lifelines of supplies to U.S. troops throughout the
        war, were operated chiefly by African American troops such as those in the 3909th
        Quartermaster's, and in the Army they found in many respects a different life than the
        deeply segregated society they left behind. Evidence of this may be found in the snapshots
        of these soldiers in an apparently un-segregated swimming pool, and perhaps in a curious
        caption under one photo, "This is EGALE," perhaps a reference to the French national motto,
        "Liberté, égalité, fraternité" - liberty, equality, and brotherhood.</p>
      <p>Homer Magee's name, along with most of the other last names and first initials, have been
        found in records for Camp Shelby, Mississippi; although the others are commonplace names and
        cannot be positively linked with the men in this album, the presence of these names at Camp
        Shelby may indicate the common starting place for the men in this album, who eventually
        ended up together in the Quartermaster Truck Companies.</p>
