      <p>Lady Elizabeth Holford was born Elizabeth Lewis around 1650. She first married a merchant
        called Harbin, whose wealth she inherited, with whom she had a son who died while very
        young. Her second husband was a poor baronet, Sir William Holford, who died before her.
        Holford's son never acknowledged his step-mother, and also died young. Lady Holford died on
        3 November 1720, without an heir.</p>
