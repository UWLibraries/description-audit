            the tobacco and textile industries and include some early financial records of W. Duke,
            Sons and Company. Other financial records pertain to Duke's generosity to relatives and
            to educational institutions such as Trinity College (now Duke University). Personal
            papers consist of correspondence, the Duke family genealogy, photographs, and
            memorabilia from the dedication of the Duke Homestead.</abstract>

         <p>The papers of Washington Duke, tobacco manufacturer and philanthropist, were initially
            assembled in 1951 from the former Trinity College Papers and the papers of his son,
            Benjamin Newton Duke. Over the years additional transfers were made from the papers of
            his sons, James Buchanan Duke and Benjamin Newton Duke, as well as from the W. Duke,
            Sons and Company Records. Gifts to the collection came from Mrs. James H. Semans (Mary
            Duke Biddle Trent Semans) in 1969; Wachovia Bank and Trust Company in 1959; and the Duke
            Homestead in 1972.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The bulk of the papers of Washington Duke, a tobacco manufacturer and philanthropist,
            date from 1890 to 1905, but the papers include items as early as 1764 and as late as
            1987. The collection is a created one; materials from several sources have been brought
            together to form the Washington Duke Papers. The collection relates primarily to the
            financial and philanthropic interests of Washington Duke after his retirement from W.
            Duke, Sons and Company in 1880. There are five series: Correspondence, Financial Papers,
            Genealogical Papers, Legal Papers, and Miscellaneous Papers.</p>
         <p>The Correspondence Series begins with two letters (photocopies) written by Washington
            Duke in 1863, when he was preparing to enter the Confederate Army. After the war Mr.
            Duke began establishing his tobacco business. This series contains no correspondence for
            the period 1865-1889. The bulk of the correspondence covers the period 1890-1905, after
            Mr. Duke had retired from the tobacco business. These letters reveal his financial and
            philanthropic interests after retirement. Letters come from the following sources: <list
               type="simple">
               <item>1. Relatives, seeking aid or sending thanks for gifts.</item>
               <item>2. Methodist Episcopal Church, South, members and ministers seeking assistance
                  for church buildings, furnishings, orphans, widows, and missionaries.</item>
               <item>3. Schools and colleges asking for aid or expressing appreciation for aid
                  given. Louisburg Female College, Rutherford College, Trinity College and Kittrell
                  College were among those writing about finances. The orphanage at Oxford was
                  supported for a number of years. Many students, both black and white, sought
                  financial assistance from Mr. Duke in the way of scholarships or loans.</item>
               <item>4. Business associates or would-be partners seeking financial assistance or
                  employment. These letters are largely concerned with textiles and tobacco. For
                  example there are letters reflecting Mr. Duke's encouragement of black capitalism
                  in the founding of the Coleman Manufacturing Company at Concord, N.C.</item>
               <item>5. People who were ill or unlucky, many of them very impoverished.</item>
            </list>
         </p>
         <p>The letters in the Correspondence Series dated 1975-1976 are concerned with Washington
            Duke's dealings with the J. W. Scott and Company in Greensboro, N.C. (1871) and the
            nomination of St. Joseph's A.M.E Church in Durham to the National Register of Historic
            Places. This series does not include any original letters written by Washington
            Duke.</p>
         <p>The Financial Papers Series consists of records of Washington Duke's business interests
            and philanthropy. The oldest volume is a ledger (1873-1877), kept at the time Washington
            Duke and his sons moved their factory from the farm to Durham. Duke tobacco products
            were being shipped to markets from Maine to California, including locations in frontier
            Montana. An account book for the Durham Warehouse covers the period 1876-1884 and gives
            an interesting glimpse of the beginnings of Duke tobacco organization. Records were kept
            of purchases of tobacco, promotion trips to Europe and Australia (1883-1884), and the
            entry of George Washington Watts into the firm (1878). </p>
         <p>A summary of the personal finances of Washington Duke is noted in financial papers
            dating from 1893 until the time of his death in 1905. These records include a journal,
            ledger, cashbook, and check stubs. They are parallel in content and supplement each
            other; they appear to have been the work of his private secretary, James E. Stagg.</p>
         <p>The journal (1893-1905) indicates gifts to family, relatives, and individuals, as well
            as transactions with institutions such as the White Rock Baptist Church, St. Joseph's
            AME Church, Louisburg Female College, and the Durham Conservatory of Music. Businesses
            noted include the American Tobacco Company, the Virginia-Carolina Chemical Company, Cary
            Lumber Company, together with a number of cotton mills, railroads, and banks. </p>
         <p>The cashbook (1893-1905) lists, in more detail, dividends from investments as well as
            donations to individuals and institutions over a period of a decade or more. Washington
            Duke was consistently generous to his immediate family and his many nieces and nephews.
            His tithing to the church covered gifts to the Main Street Methodist Church, ministers,
            Negro churches, orphanages and schools. With the coming of Trinity College to Durham, he
            made generous contributions to its finances, including small gifts to the baseball team
            and to the library for book stacks. The check stubs cover the period 1899 to 1905. The
            final entry refers to the balance transferred to his sons after Washington Duke's
            death.</p>
         <p>The ledger (1893-1904) contains accounts listing mills, railroads, and other property.
            Also included are notations concerning rents, personal expenses, tithes and repairs.
            Many names of Durham citizens appear here.</p>
         <p>The Genealogical Papers Series contains the Washington Duke family Bible (1861) as well
            as family trees and correspondence regarding lineage and descendants of Duke family
            members. The bulk of the material is photocopies from the James B. Duke Papers,
            including copies of letters which detail what Washington Duke remembered about his
            family. </p>
         <p>The Legal Papers Series includes copies of court, marriage, and property records
            pertaining to the Duke family and its settlement in Orange County, in the vicinity of
            present-day Durham, N.C. Other papers include a copy of Washington Duke's last will and
            testament (1900) and the indenture establishing the Doris Duke Trust (1925).</p>
         <p>The Miscellaneous Papers Series is composed of pictures, clippings, and general
            materials. The pictures are primarily photographs of homes, people, and tobacco
            factories. They have no dates and many are copies of originals on permanent loan to the
            Duke Homestead, a National Historic site. The homes include those of Taylor Duke
            (presumed) and Washington Duke, as well as interior views of rooms at the Duke
            Homestead. There are pictures of Washington Duke and of his statue and of three
            buildings on the Duke Farm used as tobacco factories prior to the move to Durham.</p>
         <p>Clippings are family and business related dating from 1890-1987. A Memorial Album of
            notices on the death of Washington Duke (1905) is arranged alphabetically by city.</p>
         <p>General materials relate to the Duke Homestead and include a variety of other printed
            and manuscript items. Among them are a Tribute to Bishop Marvin, ca. 1877 (photocopy);
            Resolution of Thanks and Appreciation, St. Joseph's AME to Washington Duke, 1902; a
            Resolution by the Board of Directors of the Fidelity Bank in memory of Washington Duke
            (1905); and a manuscript list of persons sending condolences/flowers on the death of
            Washington Duke, 1905. Photostats of two records in the C.S.A. Archives in the National
            Archives are concerned with the Civil War career of Washington Duke. One, dated April 4,
            1864, is a report for Co. A of the Camp Guard by Captain George B. Baker, Assistant
            Quartermaster at Camp Holmes, Raleigh. The second item is a list of men who signed up
            for three years service in the Confederate Navy. Washington Duke's signature appears on
            both of these documents.</p>
