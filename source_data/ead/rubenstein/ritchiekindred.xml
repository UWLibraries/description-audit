            sergeant in the US Army Postal Regulating Section in Europe during World War II. The
            Kindred Avin Ritchie Papers span the years 1939 to 1977, with the bulk of the collection
            dated between 1943 and 1945. The papers are primarily comprised of correspondence,
            particularly between Kindred Avin (K.A.) Ritchie and his wife, Sara Meda Henderson
            (S.M.) Ritchie, while he was serving in the U.S. Army Postal Service during World War II
            in various locations in the United States and Europe, primarily in France and England.
            Smaller amounts of materials also were sent from Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany.
            Exchanges between K.A. and S.M. Ritchie include candid comments about marriage and
            sexuality, and references to Army censorship and the scarcity of goods on both sides of
            the Atlantic. Correspondence from S.M. Ritchie and other family and friends, including
            K.A. Ritchie's mother Mittie Hahn (M.H.) Ritchie, give a sense of some of the ways in
            which the war affected those at home. Photographs, programs and playbills, Nazi
            memorabilia, and other ephemera are included with much of the correspondence.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Kindred Avin Ritchie Papers span the years 1939 to 1977, with the bulk of the
            collection dating between 1943 and 1945, and are organized into the <emph render="bold"
               >Correspondence</emph>, <emph render="bold">Ephemera</emph>, <emph render="bold"
               >Legal, Medical, and Financial Papers</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Photographic
               Materials</emph> Series. The papers are primarily comprised of correspondence,
            particularly between Kindred Avin (K.A.) Ritchie and his wife, Sara Meda Henderson
            (S.M.) Ritchie while he was serving the U.S. Army in various locations in the United
            States and Europe. Playbills and programs, photographs, Nazi memorabilia, and other
            ephemera are included with much of the correspondence. Additional materials sent to K.A.
            Ritchie by his mother Mittie Hahn (M.H.) Ritchie and other family and friends make up
            the rest of the correspondence. Small amounts of financial, legal, and medical papers,
            photographic material, and miscellaneous ephemera complete the collection. The volume
            and frequency of correspondence between Kindred Ritchie and Sara Ritchie provide an
            unusually full portrait of the perspectives and concerns of a married couple separated
            during wartime. Correspondence from K.A. Ritchie chronicles his leisure activities as
            well as his encounters with local non-military personnel primarily in England and
            France, but also in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. Due to military censorship,
            K.A. Ritchie's letters do not include many direct details about the fighting in Europe.
            Exchanges between K.A. and S.M. Ritchie include candid comments about marriage and
            sexuality, and references to Army censorship and the scarcity of goods on both sides of
            the Atlantic. Correspondence from S.M. Ritchie and other family and friends give a sense
            of some of the ways in which the war affected those at home.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
               <p>Arranged in four subgroupings: correspondence between Kindred Avin (K.A.) Ritchie
                  and Sara Meda (S.M.) Ritchie; from Mittie Hahn (M.H.) Ritchie to K.A. Ritchie;
                  from family and friends to K.A. Ritchie; and from family and friends to S.M.
                  Ritchie. With the exception of a few letters between K.A. and S.M. Ritchie from
                  1939-1941 before his enlistment, this series spans the term of K.A. Ritchie's
                  involvement in the 20th Postal Regulating Section of the US Army, beginning with
                  training at Camp Lee in Virginia through his journey home from Germany after the
                  cessation of hostilities in late 1945. At the time of his discharge in 1945 he had
                  attained the rank of Sergeant. In the first subseries, K.A. Ritchie writes to his
                  wife from posts in Newport News, VA; West Chester, PA; Cheltenham, United Kingdom;
                  undisclosed locations in France and the Netherlands; Gutersloh, Germany; and
                  Antwerp, Belgium. His letters cover day-to-day operations and recreational
                  activities as well as oblique or vague references to conditions in the European
                  Theater of Operations. Sexuality, homesickness, boredom, and censorship are common
                  themes in Ritchie's correspondence with his wife. S.M. Ritchie's letters to her
                  husband chronicle her day-to-day activities in Washington DC and include details
                  on her friendships with her coworkers at the <emph render="italic">Infantry
                     Journal</emph>. The interval between letters from Europe and the desire to be
                  reunited with her husband frequently appear in her letters, as do discussions of
                  civilian rationing and family news. Letters from K.A. Ritchie's mother, Mittie
                  Hahn Ritchie, comprise a second subseries. These letters detail family news from
                  Mt. Pleasant, NC and frequently include clippings from the local <emph
                     render="italic">Concord Tribune</emph> newspaper. Correspondence from family
                  and friends in subseries to K.A. and S.M. Ritchie detail relevant news from the
                  senders, most of whom are mutual friends in the Washington DC area or family from
                  North Carolina. All correspondence is arranged chronologically by date.</p>
