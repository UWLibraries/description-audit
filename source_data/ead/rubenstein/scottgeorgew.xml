      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection comprises two autograph, signed letters written by George W. Scott from
        Plymouth, North Carolina, to his parents on 1863 April 15 and 16. He describes escaped
        slaves: "The slaves are told by their masters before they skedaddle that the Yankees will
        take &amp; sell them to Cuba to pay the expenses of the war. Others have told them that we
        should kill &amp; eat them but in spite of their stories they come into our lines thick as
        toads. This is not a single occurence but a general fact" (April 16). Other topics include
        the general conduct of the war locally and in the state, his patronage of the company's
        sutler, activities of the infantry's band, and politics surrounding Thomas H. Seymour,
        Clement Vallandigham, and William Alfred Buckingham. Includes transcriptions of both
        letters. Acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin Research Center for African and African
        American History and Culture.</p>
