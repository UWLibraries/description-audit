        congregation, genealogy research, his relocation to England in 1893, arrangements for
        meetings and his lecture schedule and topics, his request for confirmation regarding the
        provenance for a manuscript, his writing plans and publications, and payment for his work.
        In one letter he mentions that he will be passing time with Samuel Clemens.</abstract>
