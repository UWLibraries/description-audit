            lieutenant and later captain of Co. F 80th Illinois Infantry during the Civil War, and
            later worked as a teacher and Presbyterian minister. His papers include material related
            to his military service, including a detailed, unpublished narrative of his 22 months as
            a prisoner of war at Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia and other Confederate prisons in
            Charleston, Charlotte, Columbia, Athens, and Goldsboro. The collection also inlcudes a
            manuscript of a poem by George Gordon Byron DeWolfe about Robert Harmer, Quartermaster
            of the 80th Illinois, and a Memorial Day address by Hood in honor of John Alexander
            "Black Jack" Logan, Civil War general and U.S. Senator.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection contains manuscripts of several speeches John Hood gave about his
            experiences as a Union officer and prisoner of war during the Civil War, along with his
            enlistment and discharge papers, correspondence, a photograph, and materials related to
            his work as a pastor in the Presbyterian church in Illinois and Iowa. Of particular
            interest is the manuscript of a lenghty, unpublished speech Hood gave at Greene's Opera
            House in Rapid City, Iowa in 1884 that details his life as a prisoner of war. The
            narrative includes a detailed description of nearly all aspects of Hood's life at Libby
            Prison, ranging from how news, mail and packages were received from the North to the
            aftermath of a major prison break via a tunnel. Hood also discusses his experience being
            transferred to various places including Charleston, where he was used as human shield,
            and his escape, during which time he traveled more than 400 miles on foot. He notes how
            slaves helped him along, including giving him a Confederate uniform. Along with the
            manuscript are several newspaper articles reviewing Hood's speech.</p>
         <p>The collection also includes several Memorial Day addresses by Hood, including one
            dedicated to John Alexander "Black Jack" Logan (1826-1886), a prominent Union Civil War
            general and U.S. Senator who founded Memorial Day in 1868. There is a manuscript of a
            poem written by George Gordon Byron DeWolfe (1835-1873) about Robert J. Harmer,
            Quartermaster of the 80th Illinois. Dubbed the Wandering Poet of New Hampshire, DeWolfe
            earned his living traveling from place to place, writing verses on people and events.
            According to the signature, the poem was "written in a few minutes in the National
            Hotel, Annapolis, Maryland."</p>
         <p>All the documents in the collection were damaged at some point in a fire and have
            charred and frayed edges as a result.</p>

         <head>Historical note</head>
         <p>John Hood was born on a farm in southern Illinois on November 17, 1838. As a boy, his
            family moved to Sparta, Illinois, where he spent much of his adult life. He graduated
            from the State University of Indiana in June 1862 with the goal of pursuing a career in
            politics and law. Instead, he enslisted in the Union Army, being mustered in August 25,
            1862 at Centralia, Illinois. He served as a first lieutenant in Co. F 80th Illinois
            infantry, and was promoted to captain on April 30, 1863. His regiment served as part of
            the ill-fated Streight's Brigade which resulted in its surrender to Gen. Gen. Nathan
            Bedford Forrest on May 3, 1863. Hood became a prisoner of war for the next 22 months,
            spending a year at Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia, as well as shorter periods of
            time in Charleston, Charlotte, Columbia, Athens, and Goldsboro. At one point he escaped,
            traveling more than 400 miles on foot before being recaptured in Tennessee near Federal
            lines. He was eventually freed as part of a prisoner exchange in North Carolina. He
            returned to Co. F 80th Illinois in October 20, 1864 and was honorably discharged on May
            15, 1865. In November 1865, he entered a Reformed Presbyterian theological seminary in
            Allegheny City, Pennsylvania. The following year, he became superintendent of the public
            schools of Sparta, Illinois. He received his license to preach in 1869 and completed his
            theological studies in 1870. From 1870 to 1878 he served as pastor of the First
            Presbyterian Church of Sparta, leaving on June 30, 1878 to lead the Second Presbyterian
            Church of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. He was called to service at the Presbyterian Church of
            Galesburg, Illinois in 1889. He died on January 29, 1905 and is buried Oak Hill
            Cemetery, Cedar Rapids, Iowa beside his wife.</p>
