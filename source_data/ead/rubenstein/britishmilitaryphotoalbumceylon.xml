        taken in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka); Bellary, India; Constantinople (Istanbul), and Egypt. A few
        images are from Nice, France, and Monte Carlo. The album bears no owner's name, but likely
        belonged to an individual in the British Army. On the first leaf is pasted a large coat of
        arms with a motto from the Isle of Man. The Sri Lanka images date from 1894-1895 and
        include: images from Colombo of military barracks, the hotel Mount Lavinia, Galle Face
        Green, the British Governor's palace; monsoon waves on a breakwater, polo grounds, and a
        racetrack; views from the town of Kandy and its lake; images from Trincomalee from an
        Officers Mess; and race scenes from Nuwara Eliya and Colombo. Views from Egypt show the
        Great Sphinx, streets in Cairo, and palaces in Alexandria. Images from Constantinople
        include street scenes, mosques, the port, and the arsenal, while those from India include
        servants with racehorses, and British men and servants at private residences. There are also
        images of the hospital ship "Spartan"; portraits of the B and C Companies, 4th Royal
        Warwickshire Regiment, Dublin, 1902, and the 1st Royal Warwicks in Bellary, India, 1899; a
        military camp "Marachah," possibly in Afghanistan; and images of military buildings in Sri
        Lanka. Many of the Sri Lanka images are credited to William H.L. Skeen, a commercial
        photographer based in Colombo and Kandy; several prints bear his studio's imprint, while
        others are unattributed but are probably his. The Middle Eastern views are all prints by
        commercial photographers: the Zangaki brothers (one print), Schroeder &amp; (three prints)
        and Sebah &amp; Joaillier (five prints). Many of the commercial prints are captioned in the
        negatives. Prints range in size from 8 3/4 x 11 to 5 3/4 x 8 inches; most are full-page
        sizes.</abstract>

      <p>The photographs in this album were taken in the late 19th century and document a period
        during which the British Empire had established colonial outposts in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka),
        closely tied to British-owned coffee, rubber, and tea plantations and other export
        industries, and requiring a constant military presence to counter native inhabitant
        rebellions and protest colonial interests.</p>

      <p>Bound photograph album contains 51 albumen silver prints dating from 1894-1901, taken in
        Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Bellary, India, Constantinople (Istanbul), and Egypt. A few images
        are from Nice, France, and Monte Carlo. The album bears no owner's name, but likely belonged
        to an individual in the British Army. Many of the photographs are captioned. Prints range in
        size from 8 3/4 x 11 to 5 3/4 x 8 inches; most are full-page sizes.</p>
      <p>Sri Lanka images predominate, many attributed to William Henry Louis Skeen, a well-known
        British-born studio photographer based in Sri Lanka; several prints bear his studio's
        imprint, while others are unmarked but are likely from his studio. </p>
      <p>Images from Sri Lanka date from 1894-1895. Colombo views include: Galle Face Green
        (Colombo); infantry barracks shown from the front and back, with lake, hospital, polo ground
        and club house; Mount Lavinia Hotel, with infantry barracks room and officers quarters,
        1895; and waves crashing over a breakwater during monsoon. Images from other locations
        include: a panorama of Kandy; Trincomalee from Officers Mess, 1895; Kandy with lake view and
        Trincomalee street; India rubber trees, Peredinaya Gardens, Kandy; Main Street, Pettah;
        "A.S.T." (probably the album's owner) in Ceylon, 1894; polo group, Ceylon 1894; Stewards
        Stand, Colombo Races, 1894; and Nuwara Eliya Races, 1894, "Comewell wins!" </p>
      <p>Views of Egypt are from 1898 and include the Great Sphinx; Gizeh, palace of Prince Hussein
        Kamil Pacha; Alexandria, Palace Mehemed Ali; Alexandria, palace Ras-el-tin; photograph of a
        print titled, "Birds Eye View of the Battle of El-Teb"; "Old Cairo"; and a city street in
        Cairo. Views from Constantinople include the interior of Mosque Sainte Sophie; a street
        scene; panoramic view of the city and old port; view of the Golden Horn and arsenal; Mosque
        Hamidiye and Yildiz palace; and an Ottoman porter (studio portrait). The Middle Eastern
        views date from the mid-1890s and are all by commercial studios: the Zangaki brothers (one
        print), Schroeder &amp; Cie, Zurich (three prints) and Sebah &amp; Joaillier (five prints).
        Many of these are captioned in the negatives.</p>
      <p>India images are dated later and include: the 1st Royal Warwicks, Bellary India, 1899;
        Indian servants with race horses; and Indian servants and staff outside private residence
        with two English men in suits. There are six total residential images, undated and without
        captions.</p>
      <p>There are several commercial views from Europe: Nice, France: "Cascade du chateau" and an
        image from the Promenade des Anglais, 1901; and a view of a Monte Carlo theater, 1901. </p>
      <p>Military images include: the hospital ship "Spartan," 1900; C Company of the 4th Royal
        Warwickshire Reg.t Dublin, 1902; B Company 4th Royal Warwickshire Reg.t Dublin, 1902; and a
        loosely inserted image captioned "Officers War. R. Peshawar" with names of officers recorded
        in pencil on verso. The final image is labeled "Camp Marachah," possibly in Afghanistan. Two
        smaller glossy copies of an image of men with well-bred horses in a desert landscape are
        laid in the closing pages.</p>
      <p>On the first album leaf is pasted a coat of arms with the original Latin motto crossed out,
        and a different one written below in period ink, "Quocunque jeceris stabit", meaning
        "Whichever way you throw, it will stand," the motto for the coat of arms of the Isle of
        Man.</p>
