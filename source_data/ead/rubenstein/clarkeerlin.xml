         <p>Erlin Clarke was born in 1828, and was based in Worcester, England. He received his
            Bachelor's degree in medicine from King's College, London in 1851, and became a member
            of the Royal College of Surgeons at the end of that same year, after which he
            specialized in Obstetrics in Dublin and received an advanced degree in 1853. He was
            House-Surgeon for the Worcester General Infirmary until his resignation in 1858. He
            seems to have practiced medicine for the duration of his career in Worcester, England,
            remaining there until his death in 1905.</p>
