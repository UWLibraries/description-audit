        a cream background, possibly worked in wool thread, of a white lily at top, with light pink
        accents on leaves and blue stamen, surrounded by five green and blue-green leaves. At lower
        left is a deep pink peony with white accents, surrounded by three green and brown leaves
        with veins in brown and blue. At lower right is a red carnation, with pink and brown petal
        edges. It is surrounded by a carnation bud, and two green leaves with veins in brown and
        blue. Brontë completed the piece around 1840. It was placed underneath a green velvet mat
        with oval center opening measuring 11 x 14 cm, then enclosed in a wooden frame 25 x 31 cm,
        which was painted gold, then "antiqued" on three sides. In hand-painted black lettering on
        gold paint at the bottom of the frame appears the statement, "Sampler by Charlotte Bronte,"
        although the work is not a sampler.</abstract>
