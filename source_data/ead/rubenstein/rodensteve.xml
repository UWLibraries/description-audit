         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Collection contains artwork created by Steve Roden as a result of his residency at the
            Rubenstein Library as the 2014 Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel Visiting Artist. His
            collection consists of a box containing 11 prints and 2 thumb drives. One thumb drive
            contains video files, and the other contains audio files. Roden's Visual Works on Paper
            are accompanied by his notes explaining his thought process and questions as he worked
            with Rubenstein materials during his residency. His artwork was inspired by medieval
            manuscripts, the Irene Peslikis Papers, Julian Abele and his role as an architect for
            Duke University, and other unspecified collections held in the Rubenstein Library.
            Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts (Duke University).</p>

                  <p>Roden's notes on "approaching an archive LCR": "three drawings based on some of
                     my own questions about approaching an archive and its contents, made up of 3
                     works of paper that should be exhibited as a triptych. some aspects of the
                     composition was related to notes of the form of texts in the biblia polyglotta
                     from 1522."</p>

                  <p>Roden's notes: "the four works on paper entitled 'variation' came from a

                     ideas. again from my notes - incomplete and as such, all of these works
                     converse with what i engaged with, without attempting to replicate, but to use
                     as 'seeds'."</p>

                  <p>Roden's notes: "a work on paper that came out of two incidents, one was
                     learning about the architect julian able [sic], an african american, who
                     designed some of duke's buildings, that as an african american, was not allowed
                     to go inside of the buildings... while not related to duke's archive, that
                     history reminded me of the comic book artist matt baker, who in the 1940's was
                     only aloud [sic] to draw white super-heroes, and when drawing african
                     americans, they were usually 'bad guys' or stereotypical images of african
                     natives (with bones in their nose and big lips) in books like tarzan or jungle
                     tales, etc. when i learned of julian able [sic] and his inability to spend time
                     in the spaces he designed, really stuck with me during my time at duke... and
                     hopefully someone will pick up the thread of baker's work as well... he was a
                     fantastic artist."</p>

                  <p>Collage parts from a 1972 magazine.</p>
                  <p>Roden's notes: "the two collages i made were in response to the irene peslikis
                     papers. i spent a fair amount of time with her own artworks, as well as some of
                     the other contents of that archive. before i was finished going through
                     everything in her archive, i noticed on the back of a drawing or a document,
                     that she had made a small collage, most likely from a playboy magazine of a
                     nude woman. </p>
                  <p>like so many of the things in her archive, i felt outside of certain materials,
                     but in this case i felt very much connected to her visual aesthetic. (obviously
                     the content was another thing.) so there were a lot of inner conversations
                     related to the material and how to engage with the material conscientiously...
                     but on the other hand there is a hope that something will open up or cause
                     trouble... and that collage certainly offered me a lot of food for thought... i
                     have been working with small collages from 1960's magazines over the past few
                     years, and peslikis' collages were not so distant from my own, although i
                     wasn't pulling images from playboy. nonetheless, discovering a collage on the
                     back side of a document also left me with a lot to think about. in the end i
                     wanted to engage with her work because i knew there would be complications -
                     emotionally, conceptually, socially, etc. part of me wanted to make collaged
                     [sic] with my mother, but on the other hand since i had been working with them
                     no for so long, i simply plowed forward. in the end, i made two large collages
                     from a playboy magazine from the year i was born, and made collages from all
                     kinds of images, but none of unclothed women... the hope is that my use of
                     images from playboy will cause some problems, and overall my interest outside
                     of the things i'm making, but to somehow have to deal with new situations
                     simply because i was thrust into various different worlds."</p>
