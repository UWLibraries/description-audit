         <abstract id="aspace_ebfa30c3c39305783282f7a90fd85d11">Collection comprises a photograph
            album in two sections, containing a total of 261 black-and-white prints that feature the
            athletic and social activities of young female campers. The photographs were taken by an
            unidentified teenage girl. The first section of the album comprises 51 photographs (with
            captions) taken during the summer of 1916, twenty-six of them at Camp Mascoma, in
            Enfield, N.H., including shots of the Shaker Bridge and scenes of campers canoeing and
            swimming, among other activities. There are also 8 photos taken at Lost River, near
            North Woodstock, N.H.; 6 photos of girls with other family members at Wollaston Beach in
            Quincy, Mass.; and 11 photos of Boston's Franklin Park, a children's May Party, and
            other activities. The second section of the album contains 210 photographs (of which
            only 35 have captions and 10 are loose) taken during the summer of 1917 at Camp Teconnet
            on China Lake in China, Me. These photographs picture campers swimming, canoeing,
            playing basketball, doing calisthenics, posing singly and in small groups, etc. There
            are also many photographs of campers dressed in elaborate costumes (of dowagers,
            gypsies, clowns, Native Americans, etc.), including several featuring campers in male
            attire, impersonating Charlie Chaplin, WWI soldiers, playboys, waiters, etc.</abstract>
