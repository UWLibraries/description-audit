         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Frances Klein (b. October 19, 1915) is a native of Cleveland, Ohio where she played
            trumpet in the Glenville High School Band. Around 1935, she was invited to play in
            Kermit Dart's All-Girl Band, which was led by Irene Vermillion. Klein traveled the
            country for two years with Vermillion's dance act/revue, "Rhapsody in Red." Upon
            returning to Cleveland, she was invited to tour with Ina Ray Hutton's All-Girl Traveling
            Band; after which, she returned again to Cleveland where she performed in a variety of
            local venues as a part of the Cleveland Women's Orchestra. Around that time, she was
            also the sole female member of Freddie Shafer's band. Klein led a number of bands,
            including: Frances Klein's All-Girl Orchestra, Frances Klein and Her Formal Swingsters,
            Frances Klein and her Moderniers, Frances Klein and Her Rhythm Boys, United States
            Marine Band (High School), and Frances Klein's All-Girl TV Band. On February 22, 1945,
            she married David Siskin and legally changed her name to Frances Siskin. In the late
            seventies, the Siskins moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where Klein continued playing
            trumpet in groups including the Jacksonville Bulls Pep Band, the Jacksonville Gator Pep
            Band, and a senior citizens band known as High Society.</p>

               <p>Three folders are separated into clippings, programs, and miscellaneous items that
                  deal primarily with Klein's musical career. Many of the clippings are of
                  advertisements for bands and concerts led by Klein in local clubs and bars in the
                  Cleveland area in the 1930s and 1940s. Another folder contains concert programs
                  and promotional materials dating primarily to Klein's time in Irene Vermillion's
                  band in the first half of the 1930s. There are also several <emph render="italic"
                     >King</emph> trumpet advertisements. The miscellaneous items folder contains,
                  among other items, a eulogy for Lillian Houston, who performed with Klein in Ina
                  Ray Hutton's band, an award certificate to Klein for a performance in 1933, a
                  letter from the <emph render="italic">King</emph> trumpet company, and an
                  invitation to play on a USO tour in an all girl orchestra led by Alfonso D'Artega
                  in 1943.</p>

                  photographs, and Klein publicity photographs. One folder of candid photographs
                  consists primarily of Klein's time with Irene Vermillion's band in the early to
                  mid 1930s, images of Ina Ray Hutton's band in concert, and Klein with friends in
                  the late 1950s. There are also three folders of publicity photographs of Klein's
                  contemporary colleagues, many of which are autographed and addressed to Klein. Of
                  note are images of Irene Vermillion and Ina Ray Hutton. The fifth folder includes
