         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>In 1912, the Society, located in St. Louis, Mo., held a contest calling for submissions
            of original compositions for piano. The response, according to a letter from the
            Society, was overwhelming. The Society received over 3000 submissions from all over
            Europe, and North and South America. One hundred four of them make up this
            collection.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection consists of 104 original piano compositions entered into a contest held
            by the Society. It received over 3000 entries from all over Europe, and North and South
            America. These entries were apparently intended for return to the contestants, but were
            never mailed. The compositions were divided into three classes: Class A for concert
            piano solos, intended for public performance by advanced musicians; Classes B and C were
            written as less demanding salon pieces; Class C especially for short character pieces.
            Composers were supposed to identify themselves by motto rather than by name on their
            compositions (though some used names). The range of mottoes selected is quite diverse
            and interesting. </p>
         <p>Sixty-one different composers are represented in this collection, including at least
            five women. Most of them were from Germany, Austria, Italy, England, Romania, Canada,
            Mexico, and Venezuela. A few submitted photographs and biographical information with
            their pieces. A few letters and prize lists from the Publication Society are also
            included.</p>
