         <p>Carroll Carroll grew up in Harlem, Buffalo, and Chicago. After graduating from Chicago's
            Hyde Park High School, he started work as chief copy writer at the advertising agency of
            Sigmund Tann, and stayed five years. Beginning in 1926, he worked as a freelance writer
            for several publications: the <title type="simple" render="italic">New Yorker,</title>
            <title type="simple" render="italic">Life,</title>
            <title type="simple" render="italic">Judge,</title>
            <title type="simple" render="italic">College Humor,</title> the <title type="simple"
               render="italic">Saturday Evening Post,</title> and the <title type="simple"
               render="italic">New York World</title>. He also ran a column in the magazine <title
               type="simple" render="italic">Canada Goblin,</title> wrote review sketches for <title
               type="simple" render="italic">Garrick Gaieties,</title> and was under contract to T.
            B. Harms as a lyric writer. For several years, he also contributed a rhymed motion
            picture review called <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Cinemetric
               Review</title> to the Monday evening edition of <title type="simple" render="italic"
               >New York Evening Sun</title>.</p>
         <p>In 1932, Carroll joined JWT, and subsequently went on the road with a JWT radio program
            featuring George Burns, Gracie Allen and Guy Lombardo. He eventually became Editorial
            Supervisor of all JWT radio shows, and helped produce many JWT comedy and variety shows,
            including Chase &amp; Sanborn with Eddie Cantor. During his tenure at the JWT New York
            office, he also created and wrote a full hour variety program with Al Jolson known as
               <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Shell Chateau,</title> and collaborated on
            the <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Rudy Vallee Hour.</title> In 1934, he
            created and wrote the <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Kraft Music
               Hall,</title> when it featured Paul Whiteman and Deems Taylor, and moved to Los
            Angeles to continue it when Bing Crosby took over. In Hollywood, he wrote radio shows
            for Kraft, Ford, Shell, Old Gold, Elgin, Swift, Lux and Standard Brands.</p>
         <p>In 1946, Carroll left JWT to become Vice President in charge of the Hollywood office of
            the Ward Wheelock Advertising Agency; there, he wrote and produced radio shows for Bob
            Crosby and Walter O'Keefe. He returned to JWT at the New York office in 1957. At that
            point, he produced three Chase &amp; Sanborn hour-long NBC specials for radio, worked
            with print and broadcast advertising for accounts of Kodak, Shell, Listerine, Ford,
            Lever Brothers, Liggett &amp; Myers, American Petroleum Institute, Irving Trust Company,
            and Warner-Lambert.</p>
         <p>Carroll also ghost-wrote two books for Bob Hope: <title type="simple" render="italic">I
               Never Left Home</title>; and <title type="simple" render="italic">So This Is
               Peace</title>; and wrote the <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Lux Radio
               Theatre</title> adaptation of <title type="simple" render="italic">I Never Left
               Home.</title> He created many television specials, including the <title type="simple"
               render="doublequote">Judy Garland Special</title> and the <title type="simple"
               render="doublequote">20th Century Fox Hour.</title> He retired from JWT in 1968.</p>

            <emph render="bold">Biographical Sketch from Original Finding Aid</emph>
         </p>
         <p>In a letter to <emph render="italic">Variety</emph> editor Abel Green on Dec. 20, 1946,
            Carroll Carroll (1902-) defended the role of advertising men in radio. Responding to the
            frequent suggestion that responsibility for radio ought to return to the <emph
               render="doublequote">showmen,</emph> Carroll wrote: <emph render="doublequote"
               >National advertisers and their agents do, today, exercise about 90% of the
               showmanship in radio...they would not be doing this if they were not better showmen
                  <emph render="italic">and</emph> business men than those from whom they took
               over.</emph> A showman himself, Carroll's opinions are based on fourteen years of
            experience as a writer for some of the most popular radio programs of the day. He was
            involved with the young medium of radio when advertising personnel were largely
            responsible for the development, writing, and production of programs.</p>
         <p>Becoming a member of the Broadcasting Department of the J. Walter Thompson Company in
            1932, Carroll immediately went on the road with the <emph render="doublequote">Burns and
               Allen--Guy Lombardo</emph> program, an association which lasted for several years.
            During radio's golden age, Carroll Carroll was involved with all of J. Walter Thompson
            Company's comedy and variety shows, including: the <emph render="doublequote">Chase and
               Sanborn Hour</emph>; the <emph render="doublequote">Rudy Vallee Hour</emph>; and
               <emph render="doublequote">Shell Chateau.</emph> He worked with such stars as Eddie
            Cantor, Joe Penner, Al Jolson, Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy.</p>
         <p>In 1934 Carroll Carroll created and wrote the <emph render="doublequote">Kraft Music
               Hall</emph> featuring Paul Whiteman. When the program moved to Hollywood and Bing
            Crosby assumed the starring role in 1936, Carroll also moved west and took charge. For
            the next ten years he wrote for the <emph render="doublequote">Kraft Music Hall,</emph>
            establishing a continuity of programming that made Crosby's style familiar and
            likeable--the essential factors, Carroll maintained, to the program's success.</p>
         <p>During World War II <emph render="doublequote">Kraft Music Hall</emph> became a vehicle
            through which the government programs and policies were regularly announced.
            Participation in the war effort included the promotion of War Bonds, the Junior Red
            Cross, and WAAC enlistment. Credit for <emph render="doublequote">Kraft Music
               Hall's</emph> role in providing the American people with information about the War
            and encouraging enthusiasm for government campaigns, was given to Bing Crosby and
            Carroll Carroll. In addition to writing the scripts for <emph render="doublequote">Kraft
               Music Hall,</emph> Carroll became a consultant to the Office of War Information on
            Oct. 28, 1942; was on the Writers' War Board; and in 1946 became a member of its
            successor organization, the Writers' Board.</p>
         <p>Carroll Carroll did not limit himself to radio. He also wrote magazine articles,
            reviews, and ghosted for celebrities. Among his anonymous books are Bob Hope's <emph
               render="italic">I Never Left Home</emph> and <emph render="italic">So This is
               Peace</emph>. Upon retirement from J. Walter Thompson in 1968 he wrote a column for
            Variety on television advertisement and continued to write about the early days of
            radio.</p>
