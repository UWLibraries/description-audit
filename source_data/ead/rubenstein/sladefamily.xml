      <p>Jeremiah Slade was born in 1775 in Martin County, N.C. He served as a legislator in the
        N.C. House of Commons from 1797-1800 and as state senator from 1809-1815. He was appointed
        as a Commissioner to the Affairs of the Tuscarora Indians in 1803. He was also a Brigadier
        General in the War of 1812. </p>
      <p>Jeremiah Slade and his wife Janet Bog Slade had 9 children: Afred, Thomas Bog, Mary Ann,
        James Bog (M.D.), Elizabeth, Jeremiah, William, Hannah, and Henry. Some of these children
        died before adulthood. Those represented in the Slade Family Papers include Alfred, Thomas
        Bog, Mary Ann, James Bog, Elizabeth, and William. The bulk of the papers from this
        generation appear to come from Thomas and William.</p>
      <p>Thomas Bog Slade was born in 1800 in Martin County, N.C. He attended the University of
        North Carolina at Chapel Hill and graduated with a law degree in 1823. He then moved to
        Georgia, where he practiced law and founded the Clinton Female Academy. He married Anne
        Jacqueline Blount in 1824. The couple had 12 children, several of whom are represented in
        the collection: they include Janet, James Jeremiah, Mary Livinia, Emma Jacqueline, Thomas
        Bog Jr., Martha Bog, Sella, Helen, and John Henry. Thomas Bog Slade died in 1882 in
        Columbus, Georgia.</p>
      <p>Another son of Jeremiah and Janet, William Slade, is the other prominently featured Slade
        present in the family's papers held at Duke. William Slade was born in 1807 in Martin
        County, Georgia. He also attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and
        appears to have graduated in 1824. He married Penelope Williams in 1829, and the couple
        appears to have lived in Martin County for the rest of their lives. They had 11 children,
        most of whom are well represented in the family papers: James Bog, Jeremiah, Annie Janet,
        Mary, Elizabeth (Lizzy), William, Henry, Thomas Bog, Helen, Frances, and Richard
        Williams.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>This collection (2781 items; dated 1751-1929) comprises family and business correspondence,
        account books, memoranda books, daybooks, time books, court records, and other papers of
        Jeremiah Slade, Thomas Slade, William Slade, and of several generations of the Slade family.
        The papers reflect the financial and the family affairs of a planter family of the
        antebellum South, and include student letters from the University of North Carolina, Trinity
        College, and the North Carolina State and Normal College (Greensboro); Mexican War and Civil
        War letters; legal papers and land deeds, including correspondence and receipts with other
        N.C. politicians, judges, and officials such as Asa Biggs; plantation records, including
        slave lists; and materials related to slavery and post-Civil War agricultural advances.
        There is extensive correspondence between the women of the Slade family, reporting on local
        and family news as well as offering opinions and accounts of their various studies and
        activities. There is also a fair amount of business correspondence and account logs from the
        various Slade ventures, including fisheries, logging, hog farming, tobacco crops, cotton,
        and horse breeding. Of note are the materials relating to the relocation of the Tuscarora
        Nation in the early 1800s and the leasing of their land through Jeremiah Slade. There are
        also assorted accounts and receipts documenting guardianship, personal expenses, invoices,
        and other financial papers relating to the operation of plantations and large farms in North
        Carolina both before and after the Civil War.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>The family's correspondence includes letters across several generations of Slades and
            their business associates, friends, and relatives, centering around the family's
            plantations, farming, and fisheries in and around Williamston, Martin County, N.C.;
            Tennessee; and Georgia. Early letters document on the activities of Jeremiah Slade, a
            general during the War of 1812. His letters tend to relate to the fisheries, legal
            cases, and business issues. Slade served as a North Carolina State Senator from 1809 to
            1815, so some correspondence relates to court cases and other activities of the senate.
            All materials relating to his role as Commissioner for the Tuscarora Indians has been
            removed to the Tuscarora Nation Series. </p>
          <p>The Correspondence Series contains many letters between Jeremiah and Janet Slade and
            their children, with the majority being from Alfred, Thomas, Mary Ann, James Bog (J.B.),
            Elizabeth, and William. After the death of Jeremiah Slade in 1824, the family's
            correspondence tends to center around the activities of his sons, Thomas and William
            Slade, and their families (they had 12 and 11 children, respectively). Their letters
            include descriptions of college life at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
            Trinity College, Wake Forest College, Greensboro Female College/State Normal and
            Industrial School (now UNCG), and several secondary boarding schools. A few letters
            early in 1861 are from Henry Slade, a student at Trinity College, Randolph County, North
            Carolina, until he joined the army in the same year. Henry Slade mentions Braxton
            Craven, in whose home he boarded.</p>
          <p>There is a significant amount of letters documenting the Civil War period, particularly
            comments on the organization of military companies; campaigns around Yorktown, Virginia,
            during 1861; fighting, refugees, and the Union occupation in eastern North Carolina;
            living conditions and high prices; Longstreet's Corps in Caroline County, Virginia, in
            1863; and the military situation around Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1863. There are also
            war letters between Eli Peal and his wife in eastern North Carolina, containing advice
            on farming operations; payment of taxes; accounts of skirmishes at Camp Burgwyn near
            Wilmington, North Carolina; slaves running away; difficulty of obtaining clothes; and
            references to guard duty. </p>
          <p>There is a significant amount of correspondence to and from the Slade women (including
            Elizabeth, Mary, Ann, and Helen) during the Civil War. Letters of “Bog” or J. B. Slade
            early in 1861 from Harris County, Georgia, reflect enthusiasm for the newly formed
            Confederacy. </p>
          <p>Post-war letters include general family correspondence, with frequent letters between
            the Slade women, including Janet, Mary, Emma, Martha, and Helen (on the Thomas Bog Slade
            side) and Annie, Mary, Elizabeth, Helen, and Frances (on the William Slade side).
            Correspondence also relates to the family's business ventures, including land rentals
            and other engagements with freedmen, news from the fishery, and reports from various
            horse breeding ventures. One notable letter is from Fanny, a former slave, writing from
            Texas in 1867 asking for any information on the whereabouts of her children. She was
            apparently sold away from them by the Slades. Another notable letter from Mount Airy in
            1874 tells of the death of the Siamese twins, Eng and Chang. </p>
          <p>The latest letters in the Correspondence series document the activities of James Bog
            Slade, Thomas B. Slade, and their descendents in Columbus, Georgia, and Martin County,
            North Carolina. Topics include the Clinton Female Seminary (Clinton, Georgia), the State
            Normal and Industrial School (Greensboro, N.C.), women's suffrage, Trinity Baptist
            Church (Caswell Co., N.C.), tobacco farming, hog butchering, and other business
            interests of the family.</p>

          <p>This portion of the collection relates to the work of General Jeremiah Slade, who was
            appointed Commissioner of Indian Affairs by the N.C. State Legislature in 1802. He was
            charged with the task of settling accounts with the Tuscarora, whose lands in Bertie
            County were to be leased to white farmers after the nation was removed to New York in
            the early nineteenth century. Slade's correspondence with Tuscarora chiefs in New York,
            particularly Chiefs Longboard and Saracusa, as well as his accounts of land leases,
            debts owed the Tuscarora, and various legal documents, including correspondence with the
            War Department, are all present in this series. Notable documents include a power of
            attorney from 1817 signed with seals by dozens of Tuscarora chiefs and warriors, as well
            as a few letters from the Tuscarora to Slade, acknowledging receipt of funds or other
            financial updates. Correspondence and contracts with the chiefs are signed with X and
            usually accompanied by a seal.</p>

          <p>The Financial Papers series includes financial ledgers, account books, estate
            inventories, invoices, receipts, orders, lists, slave censuses, slave hiring accounts,
            guardianship accounts, and other financial materials documenting the personal and
            business expenses of the Slades throughout the nineteenth century. Jeremiah Slade's
            accounts and financial papers have been segregated to their own folders; the rest of the
            family's expenses and income is documented in the General Papers portion of the series.
            Specific accounts relating to the Conicho Fishery, Lenox Castle, and La Vega horse stud
            operation are also present in this series. All materials relating the the Tuscarora
            Nation's accounts with Jeremiah Slade are housed in the Tuscarora Series.</p>
          <p>The financial papers of various Slade members also include their tax assessments, slave
            sales and valuations, estate sales, and personal expenses. Slave lists tend to include
            names, ages, and valuations of the Slade slaves; other slave-related materials in the
            Financial Papers are the occasional receipts of slave sales; bills for medical care for
            various slaves; and account books or lists recording the hiring out of slaves to other
            farms or plantations in Martin County.</p>

          <p>This series includes an assortment of writings and other material generated or
            collected by the Slades. It contains some diaries, essays, notes, and clippings. One
            notable item is a travel diary kept by General Jeremiah Slade in 1819 as he traveled
            across North Carolina and Tennessee. This diary is transcribed in a 1906 issue of
            Trinity Archive (Vol. 19). Also worth noting is a manuscript volume of slave songs,
            recorded by an anonymous author in the postwar period. There are also recipes, materials
            from the meetings and membership lists of Trinity Baptist Church in Caswell County,
            N.C., and a variety of clippings and scraps of printed material.</p>
