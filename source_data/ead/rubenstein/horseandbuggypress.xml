            commissioned chiefly by non-profit organizations, small firms, individual authors and

            Many projects involved the work of other artists and designers, and many were printed in
            limited editions. Content often includes poetry, prose excerpts, and quotes. Books and

                     market posters, I thought this image said 'harvest' as much as a type of food,
                     and just like an ear of corn is composed of many small kernels, a farmers
                     market is made up of many small farmers."</p>
