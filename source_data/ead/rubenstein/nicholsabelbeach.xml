         <abstract id="aspace_c9ce01b2d190b4c30b1d9beea18cc5b3">Abel Beach Nichols (1796/7-1868) was
            a merchant, farmer, slave owner and dealer from Bedford County, Virginia. The collection
            includes a small account book A. B. (Abel Beach) Nichols used to record financial
            transactions that occurred in Alabama from 1835 to 1836. Nine pages contain handwriting
            and several pages near the front and back of the book have been removed. Of particular
            interest are two pages with the heading, A list of the sales of negroes in the State of
            Alabama in 1835 &amp; 1836, followed by a tabular listing of the number of slaves, their
            names, from whom purchased, cost, date, to whom sold, time, and amount. In all, Nichols
            bought and sold 42 slaves for a profit of $21,430.58. Headings such as A list of bonds
            bought in Alabama ... and Bond on ... in Alabama for articles sold are found on
            subsequent pages. Also included in the collection are two letters addressed to A. B.
            Nichols. The 1846 letter, from Pollard Hopkins &amp; Co., describes efforts regarding
            the sell or hire of Nichols' slave, Henry, and the writer's intention to buy Henry a
            horse and dray, thereby giving him the means to eventually buy his freedom. The 1850
            letter, from Henry, respectfully explains arrangements for acquiring the title to
            himself.</abstract>

         <p>Abel Beach Nichols (1796/7-1868) was a merchant, farmer, slave owner and dealer.
            Originally from Bridgeport, Connecticut, he settled in Liberty (present day city of
            Bedford), Bedford County, Virginia, in 1820. In 1824 he built a store in Bedford Court
            House where goods imported from New York were sold, and a few years later began
            construction of his country house, Three Otters, which is currently listed on the <title
               type="simple" render="italic">National Register of Historic Places</title>. Nichols
            is recorded in the U.S. Federal Census Slave Schedules as owning 48 slaves in 1860.</p>
