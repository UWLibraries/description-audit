      <abstract id="aspace_04bc9d12384172233efa9463b5c4a850">Working-class New England family that
        was involved with both the Union and the Confederacy during the American Civil War. The
        mother, Lois Wright was born in Northfield, Massachusetts and died in Lowell, Massachusetts.
        She had at least seven children with her first husband Luther Richardson. The bulk of the
        collection is made up of letters between Davis and her children during the Civil War. In the
        late 1850s two of Lois Davis' daughters moved to Mobile, Alabama and their husbands served
        in the Confederate Army. Two of Lois Davis' sons fought with Massachusetts regiments,
        Charles Henry at first with the 6th Massachusetts Infantry, and then both Charles Henry and
        Luther with the 26th Massachusetts Infantry. Includes letters written from Ship Island, MS
        (1861-1862) and New Orleans, LA (1862-1864); and material on the riots in Baltimore, MD, and
        battles at Manassas, Malvern Hill, Petersburg, Winchester, VA, and the Shenandoah Valley,
        Baton Rouge and Port Hudson, LA, Sabine Pass, TX, and along the Mississippi and Red Rivers.
        The letters include descriptions of living and working conditions; illnesses; deaths; and
        thoughts on politics, race, and religion. Also includes letters about life after the Civil
        War. Daughter Eunice, whose husband died while serving the Confederacy, remarried to William
        Smiley Connolly, an Afro-Caribbean and mixed-race ship captain. They married in Dracut,
        Massachusetts, and she moved with him to Grand Cayman Island. Her letters, 1870-1875,
        describe their life in Grand Cayman. There are additional papers relating to Charles Henry
        Richardson's life in Lowell, Massachusetts where he worked in a textile mill and served as
        an Alderman.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Working-class New England family that was involved with both the Union and the Confederacy
        during the American Civil War. The mother, Lois Wright was born in 1805 in Northfield,
        Massachusetts and died in 1889 in Lowell, Massachusetts. She had at least seven children
        with her first husband, Luther Richardson. Her children's names are: Ann Mary (born 1827),
        Harriet L. (born 1829), Eunice Louensa (1831-1877), Jane (1833-1856), Ellen A. (born 1835),
        Luther L. (1841-1864), and Charles Henry (1835-1913). In 1850 or 1851, Lois' first husband
        abandoned her and the family, and in 1855 Lois married a Massachusetts shoemaker, Bradley
        Davis. In the late 1850s two of Lois Davis' daughters moved to Mobile, Alabama and their
        husbands served in the Confederate Army. Two of Lois Davis' sons fought with Massachusetts
        regiments. </p>
      <p>During the war, one of the Mobile daughters (Eunice) returned to New England. There she
        struggled to support herself and her children. She worked as a washer woman and also wove
        hats while surviving several serious illnesses. Eventually (it's unclear exactly when), she
        learned that her husband had died of cholera in the war. In 1869 in Dracut, Massachusetts,
        she married a sea captain and ship owner from Grand Cayman Island, William Smiley Connolly,
        who was Afro-Caribbean and mixed race. She went to live with him on Grand Cayman Island
        during the 1870s. Letters during this time describe life in Grand Cayman as well the deaths
        of Eunice, William Connolly, and their daughters while sailing through a hurricane near
        Nicaragua. </p>
      <p>Of the two sons that fought for the Union, Luther died in battle in 1864 shortly after
        re-enlisting. After the war, Charles Henry returned to Massachusetts and worked his way up
        in a textile mill in Lowell and became involved in public life, eventually becoming an
        Alderman. </p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The bulk of the collection consists of letters written between family members during the
        American Civil War. These letters discuss the family's concerns about being split by the
        war, illnesses, deaths, politics, race, religion, and employment. There are also letters
        after the Civil War up until 1912. Some of these letters relate to Davis' daughter, Eunice,
        who married an Afro-Caribbean sea merchant and moved with him to Grand Cayman Island. There
        are also papers relating to Charles Henry, the only son to survive the war. Several of these
        letters are letters of recommendation in support of specific veterans receiving their
        pensions, including a letter that describes a possibly gender-fluid, gender nonconforming,
        and/or transgender soldier nicknamed "Lucy."</p>

            On April 29th, 1861, she also writes about her thoughts upon the outbreak of the Civil
            War and what it is like to be a supporter of the Union in the South. On June 6th, 1861,

            Regiment of the Massachusetts Infantry. Some of the letters mention the tension and
            unhappiness in the family about "brother against brother in the fatal conflict." They
            also mention Charles Henry's enlistment with the 26th Regiment along with his brother
            Luther and stepbrother Osgood Davis. The letters describe the activities of the
            regiments and conditions on the ground. A letter from Eunice shows that she and her

          <p>Letters from Eunice upon giving birth to a daughter (Clara) in Claremont, New
            Hampshire, and from Luther and Charles Henry, who are encamped at Ship Island,
            Mississippi. Eunice writes about sending her son away to work and about taking up
            housework to earn her board. Charles Henry and Luther leave Ship Island for Louisiana.
            Charles Henry tells of recovering from several illnesses, searching for guerilla
            fighters, a shipwreck, and other incidents in the field. He also tells of attending a
            prayer meeting of formerly enslaved African Americans and writes about abolitionists and
            politics. Eunice continues to write about her living and work conditions and about her
            children.</p>

          <p>Letters from Charles Henry continue to report on his health and to describe his time in
            New Orleans. He writes to his mother asking advice on whether he should join an African
            American regiment which could result in advancement. He mentions the African American
            regiment in several subsequent letters. In writing he shares his racist views. Lois
            writes to Charles Henry about news of the war, her worries for her sons, and how things
            are at home. Eunice's son Clarence writes letters to his grandmother Lois. Lois explains
            to Charles Henry how she has needed to spend the money he earns from the war to help
            herself and other family members. A few of the letters mention the Emancipation
            Proclamation. Eunice writes about working as a washer woman and about making palm leaf
            hats to sell. Luther writes that he heard from prisoners of war that his brothers-in-law
            Dudley Merill and William Stone might be with 18th Alabama Regiment in East Tennessee.
            Eunice writes back with instructions to Luther to write to their sister Ellen in
            Alabama; she urges him to be careful in what he says for fear of spys. Luther reports
            that he has been working in the cookhouse. Other letters from Charles Henry mention
            battles going on at Vicksburg and Port Hudson.</p>

          <p>Luther and Charles Henry write of leaving New Orleans for Baton Rouge, Algiers, and New
            Iberia. They describe what it is like to leave a city they have been in for so long and
            about their interactions with the new regiment that is taking their place. Luther writes
            that many of the soldiers had a hard time leaving the wives, lovers, and friends that
            they had in New Orleans. They both report that Osgood Davis has died. Charles Henry
            describes the Battle of Sabine Pass in September, 1863. Luther writes from Brashear City
            about tearing down buildings and stables for the Union encampment. He also mentions that
            he has a special friend in New Orleans named Emily Hall. Luther and Charles Henry's
            regiment is marched to Camp Bisland and then to Carrion Crow in Louisiana. Charles Henry
            copies an excerpt from his diary that describes their marches and skirmishes. Eunice
            writes of changing living situations and about her troubles dealing with a difficult
            neighbor or landlord. Lois's niece writes from Vermont about losing two children to
            dyptheria. Charles Henry writes that he got typhoid and was hospitalized. Several of the
            letters mention "copperheads" (anti-war democrats). On December 26th, Charles Henry
            writes about the copperheads and Lincoln's announcement to call for 300,000 more
            troops.</p>

          <p>Charles Henry writes that he and Luther have re-enlisted. At first they are stationed
            at New Iberia, then near Franklin, Louisiana, then in New Orleans, Carrollton, and
            Morganza. Various family members respond to Charles Henry and Luther's re-enlistment, as
            well as to the news that they will come home on furlough. Eunice writes of her long days
            working as a washer woman. On May 20th, Charles Henry describes their journey back to
            New Orleans after their furlough; he includes excerpts from a diary and describes his
            feelings about being a soldier. Eunice writes that she is ill and that her daughter
            Clara has scarlet fever. Eunice wonders how she will make a living and take care of her
            home and children as well. She thinks of making hats to sell but cannot afford a hat for
            herself. Charles Henry writes of a fire in New Orleans which destroyed steamers and
            schooners. He also writes that 29 men died of sunstroke during a military review that
            included 30,000 men. Charles Henry and Luther ask their mother to send photos of
            themselves so they can give them to their fellow soldiers. They also write of their
            support of Abraham Lincoln in the upcoming presidential election.</p>
