			<p>The Memory Project Oral History collection comprises digital video recordings and written supporting documentation of interviews spanning 2009 to 2016. The interviews were conducted by filmmakers associated with the Work Station, a film studio run by Wu Wenguang in Caochangdi, Beijing, China. Memory Project interviews were conducted with Chinese people about mid-20th century rural life, primarily experiences during the Great Famine (1958-1961), but also the Land Reform and Collectivization (1949-1953), the Great Leap Forward (1958-1960), the Four Cleanups Movement (1964), and the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976). The interviews show regional variations in famine experiences and rural culture. They add intimate detail and humanity to the story of the deaths and starvation of millions of Chinese, providing a unique perspective on the unofficial history of the Great Famine.</p>

			<p>Due to the geographic scope and rural focus of the Memory Project, the interviews are frequently conducted in regional dialects. In many cases, the filmmakers provided Chinese language transcripts. Many recordings are also accompanied by prose reflections written by the filmmakers, the text of which originally came from the Work Station blog or email communication between filmmakers. The notes and blogs written by the filmmakers and the interview footage preserve the fading memories of people who lived through the Great Famine, ensuring that their stories are not forgotten.</p>

			<p>The interviews described in this collection guide are arranged geographically by Province and Village. While multiple filmmakers may have worked in a single province, in most cases, only a single filmmaker traveled to each village represented. Approximately 500, nearly one half, of the interviews and supporting documentation are described as of January 2021. These interviews include those conducted by Wu Wenguang 吴文光, Zhang Mengqi 章梦奇, Zou Xueping 邹雪平, Li Xinmin 李新民, Jia Nannan 贾楠楠, Luo Bing 罗兵, Lin Tao 林涛, Zhang Ping 张苹, Li Yushan 李雨珊, Guo Zhihua 郭志华, Qu Yufeng 屈玉凤, Gao Runxiang 高润香, Guo Rui 郭睿, Hu Tao 胡涛, Jia Zhitan 贾之坦, Shao Yuzhen 邵玉珍, Shu Qiao 舒侨, Wen Hui 文慧, Wu Haizhu 吴海珠, Ye Zuyi 叶祖艺, Yi Yangmin 易旸敏, and Zhang Haishen 张海深. Other interviews will be published incrementally as each filmmaker's material is arranged and described.</p>

			<p>Most materials are available in Chinese. A smaller number of interview transcripts have been translated into English. Those interviews that have English translations are noted in the individual interview descriptions below. All digital files are available online. Videos may be played directly through this collection guide while additional text documents and transcripts can be accessed clicking links next to the embedded videos in this collection guide, or directly via Duke Digital Collections at https://repository.duke.edu/dc/memoryproject/.</p>

			<head>Biographical / Historical</head>
			<p>In 2010, documentary filmmaker Wu Wenguang launched the Memory Project to collect oral histories from survivors of the Great Famine that devastated rural China between 1958 and 1961. Officially known in China as the "Three Years of Natural Disasters" or "The Difficult Three-Year Period," the Great Famine caused the death of between 20 and 43 million people. More recently the project has also covered the Great Leap Forward of 1958-1960, the Land Reform and the Collectivization of 1949-1953, the Four Cleanups Movement in 1964, and the Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976.</p>

			<p>Wu's studio in suburban Beijing, known as the Work Station, is the home for this project. More than 150 young filmmakers have joined the project, and since 2010 they have visited 246 villages in 20 provinces and interviewed more than 1,100 elderly villagers. These filmmakers, many of whom returned to their families' rural hometowns, developed new intergenerational relationships with elderly relatives. During the process of interviewing the villagers, they reconciled the official history taught in schools with each family's experiences.</p>

			<p>Wu Wenguang was born in 1956 in Yunnan Province, China, as is considered a founding figure in Chinese independent documentary films. His other work includes Bumming in Beijing: the Last Dreamers (1990), 1966: My Time in the Red Guards (1993), At Home in the World (1995), Jiang Hu: Life on the Road (1999), Dance with Farm Workers (2002), Fuck Cinema (2005), Treating (2010), Bare Your Stuff (2010), Investigating My Father (2016), and Gao Bo between Beijing-Paris (2019).</p>

							<p>Lu Jiwen (b. 1945) moved to Shaziying Village, Yang Town, Shunyi District, Beijing in 1961 when his parents who were intellectuals but received mistreatment were sent to the countryside for reeducation. In this interview, Lu talks about the life before and after Cultural Revolution. Because most of the work points they earned by working at the production team were used to treat his mom's heart disease, they led a very poor life. His dad passed away when the Four Cleanups Movement just started and his reputation was not rehabilitated until when Cultural Revolution ended. When his mom passed away in 1966 and his four elder sisters all left home because of work or school, he and his younger brother were the only ones left at home and had to support themselves by working at the production team. The transcript of this interview has been translated into English.</p>
							<p>卢记文1945年出生，1961年随父母下放到北京市顺义区杨镇沙子营劳动。在这段口述中，卢老人回忆了文革前后的生活。因为卢老人的母亲有心脏病，家里在生产队工作挣的工分都给她用来看病，所剩无几。63年大四清刚开始的时候卢老人的父亲就去世了，他的名誉一直到文革结束以后才得以恢复。66年卢老人的母亲也去世了，四个姐姐因为读书和工作的关系也已离家，家里就剩下卢老人和弟弟靠务农劳作相依为命。</p>

Once a pig of the Production Team in Gaogezhuang Village died, so the man who fed the livestock cooked the pig. His son ate most of the pig and was eventually stuffed to death. Because of the edible things her dad found near the reed field, Yin's family did not starve badly. When one of her kids was born, due to malnutrition, Yin did not have milk. She had to buy a goat for 5 Yuan and fed the baby with goat milk. The transcript of this interview has been translated into English.</p>

							<p>Zhang Zeying (b. 1943) is a resident of Shaziying Village, Yang Town, Shunyi District, Beijing. His early life was quite difficult as his family was identified as landlords, his mother passed away when he was very young and his father was identified as a rightist during the Anti-Rightist Movement. In this interview, Zhang recalled the life from the Great Leap Forward to the Great Famine when clothes and food were very scarce. Everyone was assigned 17-jin grains per month and eating on the Production Team's canteen. However, because a large amount of the assigned portion was also for the 10 cooks working at the canteen, the foods were far from enough. Only catres had enough to eat because they either extorted or stole from the public properties. In 1958 there was a big harvest, so a large amount of grain were wasted. However, starting from 1959 when the harvest was not good and the stored sweet potatoes went bad because of low temperature, people started to starve. The transcript of this interview has been translated into English.</p>

							<p>Wang Shihua (b. 1926) is a resident of Shaziying Village, Yang Town, Shunyi District, Beijing. In this interview, Wang recalls the life after 1949. After being demobilized from the army in 1954, Wang worked as the leader and then the secretary of the production team. He explains the operation of and differences between elementary and advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives and people's commune. To join the cooperatives, people had to pay a certain amount of money. If one did not have enough money, while poor and lower-middle peasants could borrow money from the credit union with zero interest rate, rich peasants and landlords had to pay the interest. Because of its reed field, Shaziying Village did not suffer as much as others during the Great Famine. Many girls made mats with reeds for extra money. No one starved to death but several old people died of constipation. The transcript of this interview has been translated into English.</p>
							<p>王士华1926年出生，是北京市顺义区杨镇沙子营村民。在这段口述中，王老人讲述了建国以后的生活。王老人1954年当兵回来以后当大队长，后来当了书记。王老人解释了初级社、高级社、人民公社的区分和运作。当时入社得花钱，贫下中农入社钱不够，就由信用社无息贷款，但富农、地主贷款就得花利息。大饥荒时期沙子营比别的村强的地方在于村里产苇子，好多女孩子都靠编席赚钱。当时村里饿死的没有，但有老人因为上火便秘去世。</p>

							<p>Jin Huilan (b. 1936) is a resident of Shaziying Village, Yang Town, Shunyi District, Beijing. In this interview, Jin recalled the life from Civil War to the Great Famine. During the Sino-Japanese War, most men in the village did not dare to sleep at home, worrying they would be dragged to join the army. The Communist party forced the students to go to school, but at the same time they had to hide from the Japanese. During the collectivization, whoever did not join the People's Commune would be criticized and punished. When the Miyun Reservoir was being built during the Great Famine, all the men (except for the physically challenged) went to build the reservoir, while all the women had to build the roads, including those who were pregnant or had little kids to take care of. Due to the lack of food provided by the canteen of their production team, Jin ate all kinds of tree barks. Many people got sick, developed big bellies and eventually died. The transcript of this interview has been translated into English.</p>
							<p>金慧兰1936年出生，是北京市顺义区杨镇沙子营村村民。在这段口述中，金老人回忆了从解放前到大饥荒时期的生活。抗日战争时期村里的男的怕被抓去当兵,不敢回家睡觉。学生们一边被共产党逼着去上学，一边得躲着怕被日本人发现。合作化时期虽说自由入社，但不入社就会被批斗。大饥荒时适逢北京修密云水库，村里男的除了瘸子拐子都要去修水库，女的就算怀孕或者带着孩子也得去修路。生产队食堂供应的粮食不够，金老人吃过各种树皮，好多人都得了大肚子病死了。</p>

In this interview, Meng and Qi recall the life during the Great Famine. Meng points out, because of the natural disaster, poor economy and the debt owed to Soviet Union, it was a very difficult time for the whole nation. People in the countryside lived on the work points earned through working at the production team, so they could not make much money. During the Great Famine, Qi was not married yet so stayed at home in northeast China. The life there was even harder. Her little sister had chondropathy because of malnutrition. Some people even dug mud in the river to eat.</p>
							<p>蒙士武1945年出生，是北京市顺义区杨镇沙子营村民，齐腾远1951年出生，年轻时嫁给蒙老人，搬到了沙子营。在这段口述中，两位老人回忆了大饥荒时期吃食堂的经历。蒙老人指出，当时自然灾害，国民经济紧张，再加上要还苏联的债，所以特别困难。农村人靠挣工分，根本赚不到什么钱。大饥荒时期齐老人还没结婚，住在东北老家，生活更加困难，她的小妹子因为营养不良得了软骨病，村里甚至有人挖河里的泥来吃。</p>

In this interview, Zhang and Wang talk about the life during the Great Famine. Because of malnutrition, many people had edema, but thanks to the two jins of soy beans assigned for each patient by the government, no one starved to death in their village. Many people went to pick up sweet potato leaves and other edible things in the fields so that they could send them to places like Sichuan and Guangxi where the famine was worse. For every four jins of such "foods", the government would provide 1 jin of grains in exchange. Those days, because of hunger people would eat anything. Once a horse died in the village, so many people rushed to eat the meat. However, it was a sick horse so many people got food poison and were sent to the hospital.

In this interview, Rong recalled what happened before the Liberation and during the Land Reform as well as the later checkup. During the Sino-Japanese War, there were Red Eye Army who claimed to fight against Japanese but in fact were just bandits with secret relationship to the Communist party. The Communist party did not arrive in the village until 1937. Ever since then, they always held secret meetings with poor people in the evenings. During the Land Reform, many people had to forgo and move out of their own places for collectivization, but there was no standard criteria. Whoever refused to follow the orders would be beaten up. Many teachers, including Rong himself suffered ill-treatment during the checkup—wrongly accused, beaten up and even beaten to death.

At the age of 13, Zhang replaced her mom and went to work in the production team with her elder brother while making mats in the evening for extra money. When working at the Jinji River in 1977, her brother developed mental illness. After sparing no effort to help him get cured and get married, Zhang herself was eventually able to get married with the boyfriend she had dated for years. In 1984 when Zhang was pregnant with her son, the one-child policy started to be strictly carried out in the countryside. To hide from people from the government, Zhang had to travel to relatives' places on a tractor. Worried about being forced into abortion, she did not dare to go to the hospital even though the baby was due soon. After all kinds of hardship, she finally gave birth to the son at home.

In 1958 when people could eat whatever they wanted at the communal canteen, food went gone very quickly, so the officials from the production team went to everyone's home to check if they were hiding any food. To make space for the communal canteen, many people had to move, including Zhang's family. One of Zhang's uncles was a deserter from the army, so in order to protect this brother, Zhang's dad gave away one of his sons to the cadre of the production team. Zhang Jiuru, who is Zhang Jiuxi's relative, reported his own family members to the government so that he could become the accountant of the production team. He even changed the categorization of Zhang Jiuxi's family from middle peasants to rich peasants. However, because of corruption, Zhang Jiuru was later arrested and sentenced with 12 years in prison.

							<p>Liu Huaiyou (b. 1930) is a resident of Xingzhuangzi Village, Yang Town, Shunyi District, Beijing. After graduating from a normal school, Liu has been teaching for most of his life. In this interview, Liu recalled the life before and after 1949 as well as during Great Famine and the Cultural Revolution. During the Civil War when he was still in middle school, Liu secretly joined the Communist Party in Beijing and helped the army hide and transfer goods. During the Land Reform, Liu's family was identified as rich peasants and therefore forced to move out of their own big house. The eight of them had to share two shabby rooms, in which, after some repairs, Liu is still living today. No law was strictly enforced back then, so robberies conducted by bandits were prevailing. Many people attacked and revenged others under the name of class struggle. In spite of this, Liu, who used to live under the cruel control of the Japanese, remains a patriot. During the Great Famine, Liu was provided only one steamed bun per meal, together with some radish slices. In 1966 during the Cultural Revolution when he was teaching in Shaling, he was framed and falsely accused of being an anti-revolutionist. Liu then had to go back home for reeducation through labor. It was not until 1979 that he was able to go back to Shaling to teach. The transcript of this interview has been translated into English.</p>
							<p>刘怀友1930年出生，是北京市顺义区杨镇辛庄子村村民，从师范学校毕业后教了一辈子书。在这段口述中刘老人回忆了解放前后、大饥荒以及文革时期的生活。解放前还在读中学的刘老人加入了共产党的北京地下工作者，帮八路军转运物资。土改期间，刘老人全家被定为富农成分，八口人被迫搬离自家大宅，住进两间危房。这房子后来经过修补，刘老人住到现在。当时并不讲究法律，土匪盛行，四处抢劫，经常有人借着斗争的名义滥用刑罚，打击报复。尽管如此，经历过抗战时期日本人残酷统治的刘老人仍一心爱国。大饥荒时期，刘老人一顿饭就吃一个饽饽，吃不饱就只能吃萝卜丝。66年文革期间，刘老人被人诬陷为反革命，被迫从原先教书的沙岭回到老家劳动改造，直到79年才回沙岭教书。</p>

							<p>Ye Rijin (b.1938) is a resident of Zhaixia Village, Pengzhai Town, Heping County, Heyuan City, Guangdong Province. After the communization, the commune claimed that they had a harvest of 100 thousand jin per acre. Many people died of hunger. For instance, Ye Zuoxing went to the eating hall to fetch porridge for his mother, but could not help eating all of it on his way home. His mother died afterwards. People ate all kinds of famine foods and either died of sickness or starvation. Since Ye went to the mining field to work and sold Chinese pancakes on the street, he did not suffer much hunger. During the Cultural Revolution, Ye was a Red Guard. He also remembers that many educated youths from the city came to live with the villagers. The transcript of this interview has been translated into English.</p>
							<p>叶日锦（ 1938年生）是广东省河源市和平县彭寨镇寨下村村民。据叶老人说，公社化期间，公社曾说大话宣称亩产十万斤。很多人饿死，比如叶佐杏去食堂打粥，想拿回去给他母亲吃，但他走到半路把粥喝完了，家里的母亲后来就饿到死了。人们吃烂番薯骗、野菜、糠、布菜、山将树、黄狗头等，或者病死，或者饿死。老人由于当时去矿场做工，后来又在街上做饼，没太忍受过饥饿。文革期间，老人当过红卫兵。老人还回忆了一些从城里来的知青，和他们同吃同住。</p>

His mother died in 1960 after eating some wild plants, which made her body swelling. Ye worked in a mining factory from the 1970s to the 1990s, when the factory went bankrupt. His job was to nail screws to machines. He worked in a dusty environment, which hurt his brain; he also had leg problems because of that job. Since he was working for a commune, he has no pension right now; the government also does not give him any subsidies.</p>

Ye's son was so starved that he could not stop crying; he also had diarrhea overnight after having bean leaves.

							<p>Ye Hengli is a resident of Zhaixia Village, Pengzhai Town, Heping County, Heyuan City, Guangdong Province. During the Great Famine, his wife got caught when stealing potatoes, so the production team did not give her food for two meals, which only made his wife steal other foods. People stole all kinds of things and ate all kinds of things, but people did not eat people. Five people in Ye's family died of starvation: His grandfather went to Hebei's "steaming team" to cure his swelling body, but died soon after he returned. His grandmother was so hungry that she could only stay in bed, and later she died with swollen and yellowish limbs. His father was falsely charged with stealing vats and fined 20 RMB; he went away to find food but never came back. He does not know how exactly his uncle and nephew starved to death.</p>

							<p>叶石英（1938年生）是广东省河源市和平县彭寨镇寨下村村民。叶老人叙述了饥荒期间，人们在食堂里每人只能领两小勺粥，回家蒸番薯片跟粥一起吃。她当时还吃吃糠饼、野菜、山将树叶等等，上山挖一天都挖不到一个薯粮。很多人在公社化期间被饿死，养老院和妇产院也断粮。生产队撒秧，而不插秧，没有收成，却对上级汇报滿产。</p>

							<p>Li Qunying (b. 1939) is a resident of Guanchong Village, Guangdong Province. In this interview, Li talks about her lifelong hardship. Li's mother left home when she was 5, so she was raised by her father. After the Liberation, Li was sold to a family as their daughter. However, after frequently being beaten up, Li escaped several times and eventually went home with her father. She stayed at home until she got married in 1961. Due to the shortage of all kinds of materials, Li waited in line for a long time in order to get herself a pair of new shoes for the wedding. Later when she was working at the production team, in addition to the heavy workload, she had to get up before dawn to chop firewood. If she were late for work, her work points would be deducted. When the One-Child Policy was carried out, if someone did not have the vasectomy as required, his work points would be removed. In this interview, Li also sang many old songs.</p>

In order to make extra money, Wu went out to work as a plasterer until he was over 40 years old. Many villagers went to work in other places.

In this interview, Jia talks about the life during the siege and their fleeing, as well as other various experiences from the Liberation to the Cultural Revolution. After the Liberation, Jia went to work in Beijing. In 1958, as a Catholic, Jia expressed his disapproval of the government's religion policies. He was therefore sent to a farm for labor reeducation and experienced the Great Famine on the farm. He was not allowed to return home until 1969. After the Tangshan Earthquake in 1976, Jia went to work in Tangshan as a migrant worker. According to Jia, the work in Tangshan was much more grueling than the farm. The transcript of this interview has been translated into English.</p>

							<p>Yan Zheni (b.1939) is a resident of Daguo Village, Daguo Xiang, Linying County, Luohe City, Henan Province. When people ate at the eating halls, they could only have porridge like noodle soup without noodles. If the porridge was spilled, people would lie on the ground to lick it. People also had various kinds of famine foods. Every family needed to work for credits, so Yan worked in the field at night, leaving her little daughter at home. She could not come back to her except to feed her breastmilk. Dozens of people died every day and villagers did not have time to bury them. Yan's parents also died then. Yan's first husband was from a family of rich peasant, and three people died in their family. She only survived the hunger because she was later married to her second husband, a cadre. The filmmaker's description of this interview has been translated into English.</p>

							<p>Guo Jingye (b.1942) is a resident of Daguo Village, Linying County, Luohe City, Henan Province. When people ate at the eating halls, there were not much food, because there were not enough fertilizers to yield a good harvest. The production team, to deal with their higher authorities, borrowed tables and chairs from families to fake a good eating hall. At better times, people could eat sweet potato leaves, but when things were really hard in 1959, people could only have certain kinds of famine foods. People who did not work for the production team could not have food and people would rather steal food and got beaten up. Being an accountant, Guo knew that any excess of food would be turned in to the government. Guo also recollects people working on the reservoir, who only wore scanty clothes in the winter, and that some cadres beat people there.

							<p>郭景业（1942年生）是河南省临颍县大郭乡大郭村村民。郭老人回忆吃食堂的时候，国家化肥供应不上,粮食减产，人们没有东西吃。有时生产队为了应付上级检查，吃饭"桌子化"，即从各家各户搜集桌椅板凳凑到一起，等检查完了再归还各家。生活容易一些的时候，人们可以吃红薯叶等，1959年最艰苦时，只能吃苇根和扁豆糠。不去生产队干活的人就没有饭吃，人们宁愿偷吃东西然后挨打。老人当时做会计，粮食多就得交给国家。老人还回忆了人们都得在冬天穿着单衣去修水库，工地上有干部打人。</p>

							<p>Wang Qin (b.1920) is a resident of Poyang Village, Linying County, Luohe City, Henan Province.During the Land Reform Movement, Wang's family was classified as rich peasant. She suffered through eating at eating halls and Cultural Revolution, but could not remember their details due to her age. Her son remembers that, in 1958, he was only two or three years old, and he was so hungry that he could not walk. He picked up cow dungs on the road and searched for wheat in them. Wang's son also says that many local people went to work on the reservoir and many were starved to death there.</p>
							<p>王亲（1920年生）是漯河市临颍县大郭乡坡杨村村民。王老人土改的时候自己家被划为富农， 吃食堂和文革都遭罪，但因为自己岁数太大，都记不清楚了。她的儿子记得1958年的时候，自己才两三、岁，他饿得走不动路，在路上捡牛粪，掰开，挑里面的麦粒吃。王老人的儿子还说了他们乡很多人去挖水库，不少饿死在那边。</p>

After the 1948 land reform, there was another movement of denunciation and many anti-revolutionaries were shot down. Life was good in 1955, when elementary communes were established, but went bad next year after the advanced communization. People could only eat sweet potato dishes every day and got three liangs of food.</p>

							<p>Chen Xinmin (b.1943) is a resident of Diaoyutai Village, Yindian Town, Suizhou City, Hubei Province. The Great Famine, according to him, was because the central government in 1959 encouraged people to 'tighten their belts' in order to pay off the debt to Soviet Union, the local cadres exaggerated about the grain production for their political achievements, and they made unfair allocation of the grain. Chen talks about how several fellow villagers starved to death, including the controversy over whether Ma Zhengyi died of starvation or of overeating. Chen described in detail about the Four Cleanups movement based on his own experience of being criticized and writing self criticism. Chen was found as 'clean' by the movement, so he became a cadre in the production team at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. In 1968-1969, he was the director of the Revolution Committee. Chen says that the Revolution Committee was in charge of any chaotic situation caused by beating, smashing, and looting, and his village maintained peaceful social order during the Cultural Revolution.</p>

During the Great Famine, Qiu was in middle school and his teachers led students to find oak tree seed and bark, vitex leaves and Chinese scholar tree flowers for food. All members of the production team had to participate in building the reservoir and a meal provided by the People's Commune Canteen included only two liang of rice and boiled water grass. Qiu's father starved to death in 1959. Qiu believes that the Great Famine happened partly because the cadres much exaggerated the grain production to gain political achievements, and partly because the cadres stole some grain given by the government. Commune members of the production team dared not report because they were afraid of the vengency from the cadres.</p>

							<p>Xiang Layun (b.1930) is a resident of Huakou Village, Shuangjing Town, Xupu County, Huaihua City, Hunan Province. In this interview, Xiang recalls life during Land Reform and Great Famine. For the Land Reform they struggled the landlords and confiscated their properties, and each person in her family was distributed one mu of land. When People's Communal canteen started, people could eat as much as they liked, but later food supply became limited and was not enough. The Production Team stole food collectively and distributed to each family, so not many people starved to death.</p>

							<p>Shu Qingyou (b.1930) is a resident of Shuangjing Village, Shuangjing Town, Xupu County, Huaihua City, Hunan Province. In this interview, Shu recalls experiences during the Land Reform, Great Leap Forward, and Great Famine. When Land Reform began in 1950, he was the squadron leader of the militiamen and was in charge of the military equipment; together with the new team, he criticized the landlords and divided their possessions. During the Great Leap Forward, the yield was falsely reported as a result of proneness to boasting and exaggeration. He remembers that some one made a complaint and was then critized on the same night. Later there was no food when eating at the People's Communal canteen, the Commune members ate secretly while the cadres snatched the food, and the ordinary folks also stole everywhere. Many people got the edema disease, and those almost starving to death were sent to the elder's home for treatment, most of who died as well.</p>

							<p>Luo Yunbi (b.1949) is a resident of Shuangjing Village, Shuangjing Town, Xupu County, Huaihua City, Hunan Province. In this interview, Luo recalls her experiences during the Great Famine and Cultural Revolution. People began eating "Helong meal" (eating with unlimited supply) in early 1959, but food began running short later in the same year. Her father was the branch secretary and forbade anyone in the family from stealing.  Luo believes that since it was not long after "liberation", food was not abundant due to underdeveloped technology. During the Cultural Revolution, Luo was the Women Team leader and went around for meetings, working and embroidering Mao images; besides, she had to ask for instructions in the morning and report results in the evening. At that time, all cadres were deemed as "capitalist roaders in power" and had to be struggled; sometimes sons even rebelled against fathers. The filmmaker's description of this interview has been translated into English.</p>
							<p>罗运碧1949年出生，是湖南省溆浦县双井镇双井村的村民。在这段口述中，罗老人回忆了大饥荒和文革期间的经历。1959年上半年开始吃"合拢饭"，可到了下半年粮食就紧张起来了。父亲是支部书记，不允许家里人去偷东西吃。1960年饿死了不少人，但食堂的伙夫都没挨饿。她说当时刚解放不久，科技不发达，所以粮食不丰富。文革时期罗运碧是妇女队队长，到处去开会、绣毛主席像、干活，每天要"早请示晚汇报"。当时做干部的就被看作当权派，要被打倒，有的儿子还造父亲的反。</p>

However, she also needed to make five pairs of straw sandals for the production team everyday for 3 work points. Since the grain the kids got was very little, Xia saved her own portion for the kids and ate chaffs and vegetables. Nonetheless, six out of her nine kids died of starvation. Many villagers developed edema because of hunger, and the treatment was to eat a kind of candy made from dates.</p>

							<p>Hu Jinlian (b.1938) is a resident of Songlin Village, Xupu County, Hunan Province. In this interview, Hu recalls experiences during the Great Famine. The family of nine only had two labor forces, so sometimes they could not finish the assigned tasks, getting no grains to eat. One time, the warehouse of the Production Team divided public grains secretly. Hu was sent to work elsewhere then and did not get anything; she was so irritated that she reported their activity.</p>

							<p>Xu Degui (b. 1939) is a resident of Luwan Village, Jiangsu Province. In this interview, Xu talks about his experience during the Great Famine. In 1958 Xu went to work in the city. When he came back to the village, many villagers had developed edema disease because of starvation. To cure the patients, the government distributed tofu water made of  soybeans. In 1963, although according to the state policy, Xu had to return to his village, he decided to move to Xiaoxian, Anhui Province and worked on the railroad construction. According to Xu, the famine was even worse there and there were even cases of people eating human flesh. An acquaintance of his hid a jar of food in a well and therefore survived the famine. The transcript of this interview has been translated into English.</p>
							<p>徐德圭1939年出生，是江苏省徐州市沛县鹿湾村村民。在这段口述中，徐老人回忆了大饥荒时的经历。徐老人1958年上城里参加工作，后来回农村看到很多人因为挨饿得了浮肿病。为了治病，政府给病人发大豆做成的豆腐水喝。1963年，根据国家政策，徐老人应该回农村工作，但他选择去安徽萧县修铁路。据徐老人回忆，萧县那一带更加困难，甚至有人吃人的情况。他认识的一位老人靠把装有粮食的罐子藏到井底才没挨饿。</p>

							<p>Guo Hougui (b. 1941) is a resident of Futan Village, Jiangxi Province. In this interview, Guo talks about the life during the Land Reform and the Great Famine. During the Land Reform in 1949, three people classified as landlords in Futan Village were executed by shooting, including one former head of Ganzhou Country during Kuomintang's regime. In 1958 during the Great Leap Forward, Guo, still at school at that time, went to carry ores for the steel factory. When people were eating at the communal canteen, grains were all sold to the government, people had to earn work points in exchange of grain rations. Because of hunger, they ate chaff, wild vegetables and dried sweet potatoes. Due to the state monopoly over purchase and marketing, every household had to hand in a pig and chickens, even though some didn't even have a pig. From 1957 to 1960, people had to seek permission to kill an ox or a pig. Such a policy was not cancelled until the new policy of"allocation of land to individual households" started.</p>

							<p>Chen Jiumei (b. 1950) is a resident of Pengtian Village, Jiangxi Province. Due to his lack of money in raising kids, Chen's birth father embezzled 200 Yuan and was therefore arrested. Chen was then raised up by her adoptive parents since she was 8 month old. In this interview, Chen talks about the life during the Great Famine. Although no one starved to death in her village, many people stole food because of hunger. However, if caught, the convicted would face severe punishment including fines of money, grains and work points and even going to jail. During that time, many people from other places went to Jiangxi Province to beg for food. The transcript of this interview has been translated into English.</p>
							<p>陈九妹1950年出生，是江西省抚州市广昌县彭田村村民。陈老人的亲生父亲因为没钱养孩子，贪污了两百元被逮捕，于是陈老人在8个月大的时候就被养父母领养。在这段口述中，陈老人回忆了大饥荒时的经历。当时村里虽然没有饿死人，但因为挨饿不少人就去偷吃的，一旦被抓住惩罚很严重，扣钱扣粮扣工分，甚至会坐牢。那时候还有很多外地人来江西讨饭。</p>

							<p>Zeng Guiying (b. 1932) is a resident of Pengtian Village, Jiangxi Province. In this interview, Zeng recalls the life during the Great Famine. In 1957 when the communal canteen was established, every household's pots and stoves were confiscated. The famine started in 1958. With three members, Zeng's family was only assigned one jin of rice everyday. The over 200 people at the communal canteen had to scramble for the scarce supply of food at every meal. In fear of hurting the unborn babies, pregnant women did not dare to join them. Because Zeng was usually not strong enough to get her portion of food, she had to rely on the food her dad, who was the leader of the people's commune, saved for her. Because of starvation, many people stole food from others, ate daffodils and even river mud. The transcript of this interview has been translated into English.</p>

							<p>Pan Zhenhua (b. 1945) is a resident of Huanzidong Village, Shenyang, Liaoning Province. In this interview, Pan talks about the life during the Great Famine. Despite the reduced production, the cadres of the local production teams exaggerated the numbers in their report to the higher government for their own profit. As a result, the grains were taken to the higher level government and ordinary villagers had to starve. The situation was at its worst in 1960, when many people starved to death and corpses were put in cabinets due to the lack of coffins.

							<p>Yang Deshan (b. 1934) is a resident of Huanzidong Village, Shenyang, Liaoning Province. In this interview, Yang talks about the life during the Great Famine. The communal canteen was established in 1958: everyone had to eat there and no one was allowed to cook at home. 1958 saw a very good harvest, yet people wasted a lot of food. 1960 saw a much reduced production and the country had to pay back the debt to the Soviet Union, the Great Famine started as a result. Yang was working as the warehouse keeper at the production team, so he could sneak out some food for his family to keep them from starving. However, many villagers starved to death, especially the elderly and the sick. There were foods in the granary but because it was the government's grain reserves in case of war, the government did not open the granary even though people were starving. The transcript of this interview has been translated into English.</p>

							<p>Li Xintian (b.1934) is a resident of Zoujia Village, Shangdian Town, Binzhou City, Shandong Province. In this interview, Li talks about his experience during the Great Famine. The most bitters days started in the later half of 1959, when People's Commune Canteen had no food. Not only were grains extremely lacking, but both men and women also had to go dredging and ditching, leaving the elder and children at home. The starving people were forced to eat anything they could find. More than eighty people in his village starved to death, including his mother and two grandmothers. Life became a little better in the later half of 1961, when eight liang of grains was offered.</p>

When she was seventeen, she went begging with her mother; due to his lame leg, her father stayed home and made bamboo baskets in exchange of food. Later, she went begging in another county with a girl called Xiao Huan, walking long distances on foot and very scared of people's dogs. At that time, it was fortunate to get even just a little food from others. At 18 years old, she worked in the field for work points and ate anything she could find.</p>

							<p>Fan Wanfu (b. 1936) is a resident of Beizhuang Village. In this interview Fan recalls what happened when the Japanese came to the villages with their Three Alls policy. One village was spared however because the village head gave 70% of their grain to the Eight Route Army, 20% to the Japanese. After the Sino-Japanese war, came the Jinsui Army, who fought with the Eight Route Army, and villagers continued to suffer. Fan thinks that it is wrong to torture the landlords during the Land Refore. He also mentioned that there were two to three hundreds of Yiguandao believers who were killed and tortured by the Jinsui Army, and were forced to undergo re-education during the Land Reform. Fan thinks the Backyeard Furnace movement was a mistake, agricultural production was greatly affected and was a main reason for the great famine. People suffered and some died of starvation.</p>
							<p>樊万福1936年出生，是山西省衡定襄县受禄乡北庄村村民。在这段口述中，樊老人回忆了日本军队来时实行三光政策，有个村子得以幸免，因为村长给八路军70%的粮食，也给日本人20%的粮食。日本投降后晋绥军来到，和八路军交锋，村民们生活持续艰苦。土改时斗地主，樊老人认为是左倾。他提到村中有二三百个一贯道信徒，47年受到晋绥军的严厉打压，土改时又被强迫吃荤脱离教派。樊老人回忆58年大炼钢铁是人祸，农业生产受重挫，带来大饥荒，有人饿死。</p>

							<p>Xian Zongshi (b. 1944) lives in Longju Village, Baimi Town Hejiang County, Sichuan Province. He is the other interviewee, Cheng Wenbi's husband; they moved together to the Wu family's house after land reform. In this interview, Xian recalls his experiences during the Great Famine. Because his father died in the early fifties, his mother with bounded feet had to earn work points with the children when People's Commune was established in 1958. Xian ate whatever available at the time, and got terribly ill. In 1961, the Production Team cadres and the keeper divided the village's grains among themselves and accused the Liu brothers (Liu Chaoyun, Liu Chaogui, who are also interviewed) of stealing. They also took away the animals raised by the villagers to make up for the grains. Xian became the Production Team leader between 1972 and 1983, and has taken revenge on these old cadres during the Cultural Revolution.</p>
							<p>先宗诗1944年出生，现居四川省泸州市合江县白米乡龙聚村。他是另一位被访人程文碧的丈夫，土改时作为贫农一起搬到吴家。在这段口述中，先老人回忆了他在大饥荒期间的经历。他的父亲50年代初就去世了，人民公社开始后，只有裹脚的母亲带着孩子抢工分。当时正在长身体的先宗诗什么都吃过，还得了'湿黄病'。生产队的干部和保管员1961年私分了公粮，却诬陷说是刘家的兄弟偷了，还拖走村民的牲口来抵粮。先宗诗1972年到1983年是队长，在文革时也对这些老干部实施了报复。</p>
