          <p>At least during the latter part of the Civil War William E. Tolbert had a desk job. In
            1864 he was In Nashville, and by March, 1865, had been transferred to Newbern, N. C.,
            where he was with the Chief Engineer's Office, of U. S. Military Railroad in the
            Division of the Miss. He wrote that many refugees had come into the town after Gen.
            Schofield moved farther into the state. </p>
          <p>There are a number of letters from Elizabeth Russell, a Methodist missionary in
            Nagasaki, Japan, to her friend, Emma Tolbert. They run from 1883 to 1922. She wrote of
            the labors of herself and other missionaries, Japanese customs, reforestation in that
            country, her attitude toward World War I and the Bolshevik revolution, and the large
            number of Russian refugees in Japan.</p>
          <p>There are letters from William Tolbert's brothers-in-laws, William Y. McCullough and
            Edward S. Whittlesey; John H. Oberly suggesting improvements for the civil service
            commission; Bessie L. Whittlesey, a niece; Jacob Z. Rinker and his wife Gerta of
            Edinburg, Va.; William A. Mason and William H. Derbyshire of Philadelphia; Fannie
            Galbraith; and letters to and from Mrs. Henry Greenawalt, who boarded Mary E. McCullough
            and her father during the last months of the latter's life.</p>
          <p>William Y. McCullough died suddenly at his home in Sioux City, Iowa, in 1890. His wife
            Maggie was left with a son and no money. She moved to Chicago, where her sister Allie
            lived. Both she and her son were forced to work for low wages.</p>
