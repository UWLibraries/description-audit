      <abstract id="aspace_e7b756d64677384234bca19c960e0043">Anna Mitchell was a resident of Upland,
        California. Collection comprises a letter (14 pages) written by Anna Mitchell to Sarah,
        dated September 10, probably written later than 1920. Anna describes the illness and death
        of her six-year-old son, Preston, giving a day-by-day, sometimes an hour-by-hour, account of
        his symptoms, as well as treatments and diagnoses by a female doctor, Dr. Gregory. At first
        the diagnosis is rheumatism, then typhoid, then meningitis. Anna describes his "suffering so
        with the heat," with "pain down the right side in the region of the liver," "sunken cheeks,"
        and crying with headache, fever, and vomiting. Paralysis comes later. Anna goes on to
        describe his death, the preparation of his body, the home viewing, and his cremation in
        Pasadena. She also describes her regrets and her grief; "... whose life was so much dearer
        to me than my own life, that since he is gone, nothing but darkness &amp; sorrow is left us.
        Even for those that are left me--I cannot feel that I have courage or strength to make the
        effort to live."</abstract>
