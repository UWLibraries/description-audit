      <abstract id="aspace_6dbd9b2dce91a216ad3192ff5d9dee4f">The Inter-Citizens Committee of
        Birmingham, Alabama, was dedicated to promoting "mutual understanding through assimilating,
        interpreting, and communicating factual material affecting basic American rights in
        Alabama." It formed in April 1960 at Trinity Baptist Church. The collection consists of
        typescript documents produced by the ICC during the early 1960s. It includes the
        constitution and its by-laws; a fundraising circular; a copy of the Birmingham Manifesto,
        produced by the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights; and numbers 1-14, 16, 18-25,
        and 33-40 of the ICC's Documents on Human Rights in Alabama. The Documents on Human Rights
        in Alabama are reproduced typescripts, designed to circulate to government and political
        officials to alert them of human rights abuses, violence, and intimidation, largely
        committed by white people against African American people in Birmingham.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>The Inter-Citizens Committee of Birmingham, Alabama, was formed in April 1960 at Trinity
        Baptist Church. Officers were Rev. J. Lowell Ware, pastor and president; Rev. J. C. Wilson,
        vice president; Rev. C. Herbert Oliver, secretary; Rev. Harold D. Long, assistant secretary;
        Rev. G. L Terrell, treasurer. The ICC constitution was adopted in 1961, and the Committee
        incorporated in 1962 as a non-profit. Between 1961 and 1965 the organization engaged in
        "documenting cases of alleged rights violations, both official and non-official" in
        Birmingham and its region in Alabama. According to Glenn Eskew's book "But for Birmingham:
        The Local and National Movements in the Civil Rights Struggle," (UNC Press: 1997) Rev. Ware
        and Rev. C. Herbert Oliver "did valuable work documenting cases of racial brutality in
        Birmingham for the U.S. Civil Rights Commission."</p>
