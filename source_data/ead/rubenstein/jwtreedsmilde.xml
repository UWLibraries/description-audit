            (JWT), founded in 1864, is one of the oldest and largest enduring advertising agencies
            in the United States. Vergil Reed was director of the U.S Bureau of the Census (1940s),
            Director of Research and an economist with J. Walter Thompson Company (1940s-1950s), as
            well as a professor of marketing and foreign trade at Michigan State, Columbia and
            Boston Universities. Lubertus Smilde was Reed's colleague and successor in the Market
            Research Department at JWT. The Vergil D. Reed and Lubertus Smilde Papers span the years
            1944 to 1960 and include correspondence, memoranda, office files, client files, reports,
            speeches, and newspaper clippings, as well as some advertisements. The material forms
            the body of extant records for Reed's work as Director of Research for JWT; however, a
            substantial portion of the collection originated in the office of Reed's colleague and
            successor, Lubertus Smilde. Topics include analysis of population trends and their
            influence on various markets; views of the private enterprise system; how research
            findings might be applicable to JWT clients; and work on JWT's World Markets Series.
            Correspondents include Arno Johnson, Samuel Meek, and Norman Strouse.</abstract>

            <emph render="bold">Lubertus Smilde biographical note</emph>: Known among JWT colleagues
            as <emph render="doublequote">Lou.</emph> Born circa 1906 in Brussels, of Dutch parents.
            Smilde joined the Market Research Department of JWT's Antwerp Office in 1929 following
            his graduation from the Rotterdam School of Economics. In 1937, Smilde joined the
            Netherlands Department of Commerce, but soon became involved with the Dutch resistance
            movement during the German occupation of Holland during WW II. During the war, Smilde
            was captured twice by German forces, and escaped both times. Following the war he
            rejoined the Netherlands Department of Commerce and served as Director of Trade
            Promotion in New York from 1946 to 1952. Smilde returned to JWT in the New York Office
            in 1954, and worked on the <emph render="italic">World Markets</emph> series of studies.
            In 1958, Vergil Reed recommended Smilde succeed him as Director of Research. Smilde died
            in 1964 a few months after retiring from JWT. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Vergil D. Reed and Lubertus Smilde Papers span the years 1944 to 1960 and include
            correspondence, memoranda, office files, client files, reports, speeches, and newspaper
            clippings, as well as some advertisements. The material forms the body of extant records
            for Reed's work as Director of Research for JWT; however, a substantial portion of the
            collection originated in the office of Reed's colleague and successor, Lubertus Smilde.
            Topics include analysis of population trends and their influence on various markets;
            views of the private enterprise system; how research findings might be applicable to JWT
            clients; and work on JWT's <emph render="italic">World Markets</emph> series.
            Correspondents include Arno Johnson, Samuel Meek, and Norman Strouse.</p>
         <p>The papers depict Reed, as well as Smilde, as a trained economist leading JWT's Research
            Department. In a letter to Stanley Resor, written on October 11, 1945 by Paul H.
            Nystrom, a professor at Columbia University's School of Business, Reed's strength as an
            economist is mentioned (in the Correspondence Series). Nystrom suggests Reed's role at
            JWT, recommending to Resor that Reed continue the study of population trends and to
            apply their meaning to business. This is reflected in materials in the collection, which
            contains a numerous documents showing the analysis of population trends and the
            illustration of their influence to the various markets, especially those of the foreign
            nations. The information was compiled by Reed and later by Smilde and was distributed to
            the JWT personnel and clients. In a memorandum written by Reed on May 1, 1958 to Robert
            Berry, for example, Reed provides facts on population trends and his interpretations of
            them to be included in Norman Strouse's speech (in the New York Office folder in the JWT
            Office Series). The papers also include market analysis compiled by other JWT offices.
            For instance, the JWT Office Series contains a report prepared by the Tokyo Office on
            Japanese dairy product market. Many materials throughout the collection include
            reference to the World Markets Books, a series prepared and published by JWT. The
            papers, especially those in the folder titled World Markets Books (1958) in the Subject
            Files Series, indicate that Reed had an important role for the project. The Series did
            not see the completion at the time of Reed's retirement. In a letter written to Howard
            Kohl on April 16, 1958, Reed suggests Smilde to be his successor (in the Correspondence
            Series). Subsequently, the Smilde papers, dated mostly from 1960, frequently mentions
            the <emph render="italic">World Markets</emph> books. </p>
         <p>The collection is organized into three series: The <emph render="bold">Correspondence
               Series</emph> contains letters and memos written by and to Reed as well as those
            written by and to Smilde. Reed's correspondence with a numerous JWT offices, both
            domestic and international, is included in the <emph render="bold">JWT Offices
               Series</emph>. The JWT Offices Series consists primarily of letters written by and to
            Reed in 1958. Those that date from the second half of the year, however, were written
            exclusively by Smilde, since Reed retired from JWT in June, 1958. The <emph
               render="bold">Subject Files Series</emph> contains materials from Reed's office in
            1958 and those of Smilde's office in 1960.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> contains congratulatory messages
            upon Reed's appointment to JWT and promotion to Vice President as well as letters
            relating to Reed's speeches and articles, and the 1951 edition of <emph render="italic"
               >Population and Its Distribution</emph>, edited by Reed. The aforementioned letter
            written by Reed on May 28, 1953, for example, describes Reed's sources for a report
            entitled <emph render="doublequote">Advertising Appropriations.</emph> Letters of
            especial note, which reflect Reed's competence, include those written by Reed on
            December 17, 1946 and on May 28, 1953. In the former, Reed expresses his view on the
            private enterprise system in length. In the latter, Reed provides description of the
            trends in beer advertising appropriations and his proposals for Labatt beer. The series
            also contains letters and memos written by Smilde, who was involved with the study of
            international markets and collected information from a variety of publications in the
            world. In a memorandum dated on August 26, for example, Smilde provides Richard Brecker,
            the head of the New Business Department, with information on Janome Machine Company, one
            of the largest Japanese sewing machine manufacturing company. The information was based
            on a German newspaper clipping, a copy of which is attached to the memo. The Subject
            Files Series also contains Smilde's correspondence, particularly that with Samuel
            Meek.</p>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">JWT Offices Series </emph>contains Reed's correspondence of 1958
            with a numerous JWT offices, both domestic and international. Letters to the European
            offices frequently mentions a visit of Advance Survey Team. The team was, under Public
            Law 480, to study possibilities for promotion and sale of American feed grain and was
            scheduled to visit Belgium, England, Germany (West), Greece, Holland, and Italy. The New
            York Office was asked to send a letter of introduction to the JWT offices in those
            countries where the team was to visit (see for example a letter written by Reed on April
            15, 1958 to Douglas Saunders at the London Office). The JWT Offices Series also contains
            Smilde's correspondence, which mostly dates from the second half of the year 1958. After
            Reed's retirement in June, 1958, Smilde was apparently the main correspondent for the
            Research Department, especially on the matters related to the <emph render="italic"
               >World Markets</emph> books. The Correspondence Series also includes Smilde's 1960
            letters discussing the matters related to the Series (see for example Smilde's
            memorandum to Howard Kohl on April 1, 1960). </p>
         <p>The Subject Files Series contains materials related to the researches undertaken by Reed
            and his team. There is, for example, a folder titled <emph render="doublequote"
               >Interurbia,</emph> a study of urban growth and decentralization in the Northeastern
            part of the U.S. conducted jointly by JWT and the School of Architecture and Design of
            Yale University. Other materials illustrate Reed's association with government agencies.
            For example, the series contains a folder consisting of papers documenting Reed's
            activities as a member of the Travel Advisory Committee, which was organized by Bureau
            of Foreign Commerce of the U.S. Department of Commerce in 1958. The series, however,
            scarcely provides information on Reed's other activities with government agencies. A
            note written by Reed on May 31, 1956, for example, verifies that Reed was a member of
            the U.S. Trade Mission to Japan (in the Correspondence Series), but the papers hardly
            illustrate Reed's activities in this capacity. The materials dated from 1960 in the
            Subject Files Series derived from Smilde's office, including, as mentioned above,
            Smilde's correspondence with Samuel Meek.</p>
         <p>The Papers are incomplete in that the collection consists mostly of materials
            originating in only the years 1958 and 1960. A note dating January 14, 1958 indicates
            that Reed's files going back to 1955 had once existed (in the Correspondence Series).
            According to the note, the contents of the 1955 files were similar to those of the 1958
            files, but the number of the 1955 files was much higher than that of the 1958 files as
            the former included numerous client files. </p>
