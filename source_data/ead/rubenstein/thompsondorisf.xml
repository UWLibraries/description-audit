      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection comprises a manuscript journal and log book (59 pgs+ blanks) authored by
        Thompson while on a voyage between England and Jamaica from March 25 to April 28, 1935.
        However, the journal actually closes with a description of her train trip home on April 29.
        Includes Thompson's 33 black-and-white photographs, 2 telegrams she received from a Captain
        Greenhill, her certificate of discharge, and an Irish sweepstakes ticket for the Derby
        syndicate (dated June 5) that she purchased during the voyage. In addition, Thompson copied
        into the journal a 3-pg informational article on bananas, written by H.C. Bower, and kept a
        record of the ship's log for the trip. The S.S. Tetela was a cargo and occasional passenger
        ship that belonged to the banana-importing firm Elders &amp; Fyffes, a wholly owned
        subsidiary of the United Fruit Company.</p>
      <p>All the entries in the piece indicate that Thompson was an experienced sailor and had
        navigational training, "Started work this morning. The ship's Log Book had been filled up
        last trip, and they couldn't get a new one at Rotterdam, so the entries for the last few
        days had been made on odd sheets of paper. I re-wrote these on official paper and....
        Continued making all entries during the trip (pgs. 1-2)." The Tetela sailed from Southampton
        and arrived at Port Antonio, Jamaica, a fortnight later. Over the next week, the ship took
        on a large cargo of bananas at Montego Bay, Bowden, and Kingston, where five passengers
        joined the ship for the homeward voyage. The ship birthed at Garston Docks, Liverpool, two
        weeks later. In the journal, Thompson does not record what duties she carried out as
        stewardess. Instead, she recorded weather, passing ships, as well as sea life, but mainly
        focused on describing, with an active sense of humor, staff activities, meals, gossip,
        recreation, and teasing aboard ship. She also detailed a day trip she took to Port Antonio,
        the loading of bananas as cargo, as well as her contacts with officials of the United Fruit
        Company and family members of the ship's staff. The photographs document much of her
        description, but include several images of Thompson taken by the Tetela's captain.</p>
