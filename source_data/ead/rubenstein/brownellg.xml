         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Grace Donald Brownell was born 28 February 1893 at Butler, New Jersey and eventually
            married Ezra Caryl Brownell. Ezra, or Caryl as he was known to friends, family, and
            colleagues, was born in Brooklyn, New York on 21 December 1889 to Ezra and Caryle
            Brownell. The couple resided in Ridgefield Park, NJ. In August 1918 Ezra was hired by
            the Asia Banking Corporation to manage the corporation's branch in Tientsen, China. The
            couple travelled by train from New Jersey to San Francisco in the fall of 1918 making
            stops in Provo, Denver, and Salt Lake City. The couple boarded the S.S. Nanking in
            September 1918 making stops in Honalulu and Yokohama, Japan before arriving at Beijing
            in October 1918. While settling into life in Beijing the couple toured other foreign
            concessions and various Beijing neighborhoods, took day trips to other nearby cities,
            attended church services of numerous denominations, and socialized with other western
            and native Chinese families. The couple remained in Beijing until May 1919 when Ezra
            moved to Tientsen to begin preparations for the bank's grand opening before joined by
            Grace in June. In January 1921 the couple bagan making preparations for the return
            journey planning stops in Japan, Sri Lanka, Yemen, Egypt, Italy, France, and the British
            Isles en route to the United States. The couple eventually settled in Oradell, Bergen
            County, New Jersey.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection consits primarily of letters written by Grace Donald Brownell to friends
            and family in New Jersey. However, also present are scattered letters of Ezra Carly
            Brownell.</p>
         <p>Letters of 1918 primarily describe the couple's journey from New Jersey to San Francisco
            and the voyage to China on the S.S. Nanking. Present are descriptions of the cities of
            Salt Lake City and Provo, Utah, including a visit to the Great Salt Lake and San
            Francisco, California. Letters also describe the voyage from San Francisco to Shanghai
            including missionaries, Y.M.C.A workers, schoolteachers, and Red Cross workers aboard
            the S.S. Nanking; stops in Honalulu, Hawaii and Yokohama, Japan. Letters also offer
            observations of Japanese and Chinese cultures, the laboring poor in China, the effects
            of embargo on the native population, and differences in local dress based on class and
            gender.</p>
         <p>Letters of 1919 offer descriptions of life in Beijing and Tientsen, China. Letters prior
            to the couples' relocation to Tientsen describe visits to a local convent, orphanage,
            tea house, market, and temple; preparations for and celebrations of the Chinese New
            Year; modes of Chinese worship and perceived "superstitions"; and activities with the
            local Woman's Club. Letters from Tientsen include detailed descriptions of the couples'
            home and furnishings, Bastille Day celebrations in the local French settlement, the
            activities and services of various religious denominations including the Church of
            England, Union Church, Catholic Church and Christian Science, meetings with numerous
            diplomats and dignitaries including the American, British, and Prussian Consuls and the
            Chinese Commissioner of Foreign Affairs, as well as Grace's teaching position at a
            Methodist Mission School.</p>
         <p>Letters of 1920 and 1921 continue to focus on the couples' daily life in Tientsen
            including various club activities, trips into the country side, the cost of goods,
            services, and various commodities, and descriptions of a visit to a Womens Temple. Many
            of the letters, however, discuss social and political developments in China including
            student demonstrations and unrest, the boycott of Japanese goods, and the beginning of
            factionalism within the military mentioning General Wu Peifu of the Zhili clique and
            accusations of other factions collaborating with the Japanese. Letters also describe the
            influx of refugees into Tientsen from the provinces due to famine and factional fighting
            and various foreign relief efforts.</p>
