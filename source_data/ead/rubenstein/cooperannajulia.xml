      <abstract id="aspace_e6abdd6c5af1ccf7a8025ec3d42fd4ae">Anna Julia Cooper was an American
        author, educator, sociologist, speaker, Black Liberation activist, and one of the most
        prominent African-American scholars in United States history. Collection comprises 9 items
        from and to Anna Julia Cooper regarding the disposition and placement of the Charlotte
        Forten Grimke diaries and her desire to bring all five of Grimke's diaries into a single
        repository. Cooper was likely Grimke's literary executor and was trying to obtain three of
        five diaries from the possession of Prof. Ray A. Billington, professor of history at Smith
        College and Northwestern University. Billington tried to convince Copper to place all five
        diaries in one place (either the Library of Congress or Howard University). Billington also
        corresponded with Dorothy Porter, head of the negro collection at Howard University, and
        Rayford Logan, professor of history at Howard University, to inform them of his attempts to
        persuade Cooper to place the diaries there. Cooper eventually decided Howard University was
        the place where the diaries should be preserved. In addition, there are three letters
        regarding Cooper's endorsement of the appointment of Charles Wesley to the Washington, D.C.,
        School Board in 1936. Also, there is a program for a religious service held for
        Frelinghuysen University in 1934.</abstract>

      <p>Anna Julia Cooper was an American author, educator, sociologist, speaker, Black Liberation
        activist, and one of the most prominent African-American scholars in United States history.
        Upon receiving her Ph.D. in history from the University of Paris-Sorbonne in 1924, Cooper
        became the fourth African-American woman to earn a doctoral degree. She was also a prominent
        member of the African-American community in Washington, D.C., and a member of Alpha Kappa
        Alpha sorority.</p>
