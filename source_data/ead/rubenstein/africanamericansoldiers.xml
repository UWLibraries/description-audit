        photograph album containing 158 black-and-white and a few color photographs, belonging to
        African American soldier Henry Heyliger, named numerous times in the album. Most of the
        photographs document the 610th Port Company based in Yokohama, Japan, 1947, and many are
        labeled with soldier's names and some locations. In addition to a few formal portraits,
        there are many snapshots showing African American soldiers marching, working at the base,
        relaxing, and posing with Japanese women. One image shows a few U.S. soldiers, including
        Heyliger, visiting and eating with the family household of a young Japanese man, possibly a
        worker at the base. A large group photograph shows 18 members of the 120th Tng (Training?)
        Company and Regiment. There are two U.S. photographs, showing African Americans enjoying
        Hamid Pier beach in Atlantic City, and an Atlantic City postcard. Acquired as part of the
        John Hope Franklin Research Center for African and African American History and Culture at
        Duke University.</abstract>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The images in the album date to a time during the occupation of Japan by American forces in
        1947. Yokohama was about 20 miles from Tokyo and served as a port that received enormous
        shipments of supplies for the U.S. Army in Japan. Most of the labor was performed by African
        American servicemen, with a large contingent of Japanese labor as well. Some of these
        Japanese individuals are pictured in the photographs. </p>
      <p>The black and white soldiers at the time lived in separate quarters, but some aspects of
        Army life were slowly becoming desegregated, especially for officers. In July 1948,
        President Trumann would order the integration of the entire Army.</p>
      <p>Little is known of Henry Heyliger, the apparent owner of the album. In one photograph the
        middle initial "A" seems to appear. He was likely a member of the 2nd Regiment of the 120th
        Training (Tng) Company. According to the postcard addressed to him in the collection, his
        U.S. military base location was San Francisco, California, where the soldiers embarked for
        Japan 1947.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection comprises a 9 1/4 x 13 inch accordion-bound album containing 158 black-and-white
        and a few color photographs, belonging to African American soldier Henry Heyliger. His name
        is found in the album in photograph captions, in an inscription to him on another soldier's
        portrait, and on a postcard addressed to him.</p>
      <p>Most of the photographs document the 610th Port Company based in Yokohama, Japan, 1947, and
        many are labeled with soldier's names and some locations. In addition to formal portraits,
        there are many snapshots showing the men around base, marching, working, relaxing, and
        posing with Japanese women. One image shows a few U.S. soldiers, including Heyliger,
        visiting and eating with the family household of a young Japanese man, possibly a worker at
        the base. A large group photograph shows 18 members of the 120th Tng (Training?) Company and
        Regiment. Also found laid in is a newspaper clipping. A few of the pages are separated from
        the original bindings. </p>
      <p>Included in the album are two snapshots taken in the U.S., showing African Americans
        enjoying Hamid Pier beach in Atlantic City, as well as an Atlantic City color postcard
        addressed to Henry Heyliger at a military base in San Francisco (crossed out, with Los
        Angeles military address added), from "Doris," who is probably the Doris Hensley in a
        photograph mounted on the same page as a larger color hand-tinted) photograph of Henry
        Heyliger. </p>
      <p>Acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin Research Center for African and African American
        History and Culture at Duke University.</p>
