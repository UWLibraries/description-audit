         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The Literacy through Photography (LTP) program in the Durham Public Schools was started
            in 1989 by photographer, teacher, and writer Wendy Ewald. The program encourages
            students to find their voice through photographs and written text; students photograph
            scenes from their lives and then learn to develop and print the film in the school
            darkroom. These images become the catalyst for subsequent written investigation of self,
            community, family, and dreams. LTP provides training to middle and elementary school
            teachers, and partners university students and community volunteers with LTP
            classrooms.</p>
         <p>Since 1990, LTP has worked intensively in Durham with children of diverse ages and
            backgrounds. The emphasis on children's lives and environments as the source of their
            own creative expression, as well as the focus on the material procedures of photography,
            has gained international attention. LTP has been invited to give workshops and train
            teachers and arts organizations throughout the United States and internationally,
            setting a standard for innovative arts education programs.</p>
         <p>In 1994, LTP joined the Duke Center for Documentary Studies. From 1994-1999 the majority
            of LTP materials produced in classrooms were either given back to the students or
            remained in the classroom with the teacher. In 1999, LTP made plans to create an
            archive, and began the process of collecting past work from LTP teachers. The task of
            collecting and organizing this work, from 1994-1999, was undertaken by Julia Beck
            Hoggson in the fall of 1999. The material was transferred to the Rubenstein Library in
            2002.</p>
         <p>The LTP project in Arusha, Tanzania, began in 2004 when Sister Cities of Durham brought
            two Tanzanian teachers to the Center for Documentary Studies to attend an LTP workshop.
            Building on these connections, LTP staff and Duke Engage students traveled to Arusha in
            2008 and 2009 to offer workshops to hundreds of primary-school teachers, from all over
            the district, and to co-teach lessons that involved more than 2,450 students. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Duke University Center for Documentary Studies Literacy Through Photography Records
            comprise negatives, contact sheets, and written work (generally handwritten or printed
            observations, comments, stories, poems, drawings) documenting school childrenâ€™s views of
            their community, Durham, NC. The materials would be useful to those interested in visual
            culture, the psychogeography of children, and Durham history, society and living
            environment, as well as those interested in pedagogy and developing an arts-based
            curriculum in public schools. The units collected and organized in the Records are LTP
            class projects, sorted first by format, then chronologically. </p>
         <p>Along with the physical negatives, contact sheets, and writings transferred to the
            Rubenstein Library in 2002, LTP coordinators provided detailed supplementary information
            about the compilation, organization, and selection process of the collection, as well as
            a finding aid in the form of an Excel database. The Excel file is a master database of
            individual student projects organized by year, and sortable by other variables; the
            database is accessible electronically at the Rubenstein Library. A print copy of the
            database and other supporting documentation is also available in the RMBSCL inventory
            file, and should be consulted by patrons using this collection.</p>
         <p>The collection also includes 56 exhibit-quality color prints of LTP in Tanzania include
            images of children learning to use digital cameras, demonstrating their literacy skills,
            and exhibiting their projects. Also includes images of some volunteers, LTP staff, and
            Tanzanian teachers.</p>

               <p>The LTP project in Arusha, Tanzania, began in 2004 when Sister Cities of Durham
                  brought two Tanzanian teachers to the Center for Documentary Studies to attend an

                  the district, and to co-teach lessons that involved more than 2,450 students.
                  These experiences culminated with a public exhibition of children's work.</p>
               <p>The 56 prints in this series document the collaborative LTP process in Tanzania,
                  including children's assignments; group work; instruction in photography, history,
                  geography, life skills, math, and science; and exhibitions of the final projects

                  <p>This project at Themi Secondary School began with a history lesson about how
                     East Africans were enslaved through the sale of prisoners and people with debt,
                     ambush, and direct raid on vulnerable villages. Following this lecture,
                     students moved freely around the schoolyard as they considered the best
                     backgrounds and angles for pictures representing these enslavement tactics.
                     Once they made their photographs, students wrote about the images from either
                     the perspective of an enslaved person or that of a slave trader. 17" x 13"

                  <p>LTP Assignments often begin with a lively brainstorming discussion among
                     students. In contrast to the traditional approach where teachers dictate
                     lessons, these students at St. Margaret's Academy generated their own ideas
                     related to an assigned theme. Their brainstorming list will then guide their
                     photographic choices. 19" x 13" digital pigment print.</p>

                  <p>During advanced LTP workshops, Tanzanian teachers design their own LTP
                     curriculum specifying content (how the activity fits into the standard
                     curricula) and logistics (how to accomplish the project considering class size
                     and available photographic supplies). This photograph, representing "quiet,"
                     was made by teachers to illustrate concepts related to gender in high school
                     "life skills" courses, which also cover topics like HIV and home economics. 19"
