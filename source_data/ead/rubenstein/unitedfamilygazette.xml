            copy of the Gazette (11 pgs, handstitched), plus an envelope. The Gazette contained a
            personal and detailed account of the marriage of Charlotte Elizabeth Octavia Collinson
            (1817-1850) to Charles Stansfield Rawson (1812-1863). The writer of the account was
            unidentified, but was probably one of Collinson's sisters. There are sections on the
            bridesmaids, ceremony, cake, wedding breakfast, and other celebrations, as well as
            desciptions of various family members. Rawson lived at Nether Wasdale, Cumberland, and
            married Charlotte at Boldon Church on Feb. 18, 1840. Later, two of their sons went to
            Queensland, where they made a fortune in ranching and pioneered the settlement of Mckay.
            The envelope, postmarked 1895, is illustrated and addressed to E. Rawson, Imperial
            Hotel, Brisbane, Queensland.</abstract>
