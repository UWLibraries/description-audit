      <p>Jeannette Rankin (1880-1917), from Montana, was the first woman elected to the U.S.
        Congress, serving two terms in the House of Representatives (1917-1919, and 1941-1943). She
        was an active suffragist and campaigned as a Republican. Rankin voted against the U.S.
        declaration of war on Germany in 1917, and was the sole opposing vote in the U.S. Congress
        declaration of war on Japan in 1941.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection contains approximately 50 letters, largely congratulatory, mailed to Jeannette
        Rankin following her congressional vote opposing the United States' declaration of war on
        Germany in 1917. These letters are from strangers and non-constituents, largely women; most
        discuss woman's suffrage and the desire for peace, and applaud Jeannette Rankin's bravery
        for voting her conscience. </p>
      <p>Collection also includes assorted materials from Rankin's lecture tours in New York,
        including itemized statements from a New York advertising agency in 1917, and a promotional
        flyer with an image of Jeannette Rankin from 1933. There is blank stationary letterhead from
        her second congressional term. </p>
      <p>Finally, the collection also includes two letters from Rankin's mother, Olive Pickering
        Rankin, to her brother, Wellington Rankin; these are undated but appear to be from
        approximately 1917-1920s. Olive Rankin discusses her immense dislike of Washington D.C., and
        her dislike of the people (including suffragist Cornelia Swinnerton) she has met there. One
        quote from the August 27 (year not included in the letter, although perhaps 1917): "I stay
        here because I know I am needed though perhaps Jeannette would rather I would not. She has a
        peculiar liking for a set of New Yorkers. Miss Craft, Miss Swinnerton, and others who would
        run the house if I were not here. They think with a few jewels and an immense amount of
        flattery they can own Jeannette, but I have a prior claim. Truly Wellington if you knew the
        people they would disgust you especially Swinny I think of swine whenever I look at her."
