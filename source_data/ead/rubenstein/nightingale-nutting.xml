            oral introduction recorded in 1939 by nursing historian Adelaide Nutting to accompany a

            re-mastered version of the few sentences spoken by Nightingale, along with Nutting's
            introduction, is about seven minutes long, and seems to have been originally published
            on an audiodisc by the Omnivox Company in 1939. The audiocassettes were produced
            sometime in the 1970s and the 1990s by Duke University Medical Center Library staff from
            an unknown sound recording source; the later copy may be used as a listening copy. A
            printed transcript is available with the cassettes. Acquired as part of the History of
