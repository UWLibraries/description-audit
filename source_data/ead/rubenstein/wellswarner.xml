      <p>Warner Wells (1913-1991) was a Durham native and Duke alumnus, earning his B.A. and M.D.
        and then working as a resident in the surgery department between 1943 and 1949. He served in
        the U.S. Army as a neurosurgeon from 1944 to 1946.</p>
      <p>Following World War II, Wells traveled to Hiroshima as part of the Atomic Bomb Casualty
        Commission to learn about radiation injuries and illness. His work there led to ongoing
        research and interest in Japanese culture, and he began to learn Japanese. While on the
        ABCC, Wells met Dr. Michihiko Hachiya, a physician at the Hiroshima Communications Hospital.
        Hachiya's diary about the immediate aftermath of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima, including the
        activities of him and his wife, Yaeko, was published serially in Teishin Igaku, a Japanese
        medical journal. Hachiya shared the original diary with Wells, who worked on a translation
        with the help of Dr. Neal Tsukifuji. The diary was initially titled Hiroshima Atom Bomb
        Gossip.</p>
      <p>The translation was published by University of North Carolina Press in 1955, the same year
        the Dr. Wells moved to UNC as a member of their surgical faculty.</p>
      <p>Warner Wells was married to Rebecca Atzrodte and the couple had five children. He died in
        1991.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The bulk of the collection consists of holograph and typescript drafts of Hiroshima Diary
        and its earlier iterations. Early versions are holograph copies prepared in Japanese by
        Michihiko Hachiya or his wife, Yaeko Hachiya. English translations initially titled as
        Hiroshima Atom Bomb Gossip later evolved to the 1955 galleys for Hiroshima Diary. </p>
      <p>The collection also includes several disbound folios of press clippings and comments
        following the volume's publication; assorted stray correspondence from Hachiya; photographs
        from Hiroshima, including the city center and victims, as well as of Hachiya's hospital;
        some assorted Japanese publications about Hiroshima with manuscript English captions or
        other annotations; and a scroll depicting the bombing, sent to Hachiya by his friend Shuka
        Takahashi in 1945.</p>

          <p>A painted scroll (69"x16") in the form of an illustrated letter, sent to Dr. Hachiya by
            his friend, artist Shuka Takahashi, five weeks after the bombing of Hiroshima. Marked on
            gasenshi, Chinese drawing paper that has the elongated form of a kakemono scroll. The
            image is a metaphorical representation of the moment of the bomb blast: an angry god of
            wind is releasing air from a huge sack. At the bottom, the city of Hiroshima burns
            amidst a haze of smoke and fire. Takahashi's picture includes tiny details -- fallen
            telephone poles, ruined houses, and running figures -- dwarfed by the devestation of the
            great pikadon (flashboom). Takahashi's text in the scroll's center expresses sadness at
            the state of the city and relief that his friend is alive.</p>

          <p>Scrapbook (17 inches x 22 inches, 95 pages) for Hiroshima Diary. The scrapbook was
            likely created and maintained between 1955 and 1970 by the University of North Carolina
            Press, the volume's publisher, or by Wells. Inside are photocopies of articles, book
            reviews, recommendation lists, commentaries, best-seller lists, and other material
            provided to the Press by an outside clippings service. Clippings were primarily from the
            United States, but there were several from locations around the world. There are also
            newspaper articles on related topics, such as the 10th anniversary of the dropping of
            the atom bomb and "the atomic age," studies of positive uses for nuclear power, and on
            the lessons Hiroshima provides regarding preparedness for nuclear attack. Additional
            material includes press releases; letters to the author of the diary, Dr. Hachiya, and a
            few of his replies; sales accounting reports for 1960; and a 1961 report on the
            scholarship fund Hachiya established with his royalties. Includes two black-and-white
            photographs.</p>
