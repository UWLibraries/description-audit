      <abstract id="aspace_319383cffc2ebbde1765ccf47b10ce0c">Collection comprises a bill of
        indictment for perjury against "Blender," an African-American woman who allegedly falsely
        accused a man of rape. Contains a list of 10 witnesses in the case, including seven women.
        In 1807 Blender accused Jonas Fairlamb of raping her, resulting in pregnancy. The indictment
        also mentions the alleged crime of "bastardy," but those words have been crossed out.
        Blender appeared before the justice of the peace for Delaware County, Pennsylvania, but now,
        some months later, it appears that she perjured herself. The indictment contains a
        description of the alleged sexual assault, and lists the contradictions in Blender's account
        of the rape and the timeline of events. Blender is charged with committing "wilfull &amp;
        corrupt perjury to the great displeasure of Almighty God." The docketing on the bill lists
        the foreman of the jury as Thomas Smith, and notes that the defendant, having been
        arraigned, pleads "non cul[pabilis]," or not guilty. Acquired as part of the John Hope
        Franklin Research Center for African and African American History and Culture.</abstract>
