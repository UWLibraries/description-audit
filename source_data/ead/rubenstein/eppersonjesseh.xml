        resident of Durham, N.C. and director of the Durham County Public Health Department.
        Collection comprises correspondence, clippings, and photographs relating to his life and
        career. Subjects in the many photocopied news clippings center around Durham public health
        and sanitation history in the early 20th century, including efforts to combat communicable
        diseases such as tuberculosis and venereal disease in both white and African American
        populations. Includes 19 black-and-white photographs, mostly local news photographs, among
        which are 1920s views of downtown Durham, N.C.; interiors of the new Health Department
        laboratory in 1915; portraits of nurses and other staff, several of whom are people of
        color; and a 1920s group photograph of twenty local midwives, chiefly African American or
        multiracial women.</abstract>

      <p>Dr. J. H. (Jesse Harrison) Epperson was born in Kentucky in 1889. He received his medical
        degree from Oklahoma A&amp;M in 1914 and joined the Durham City Department of Health in June
        1915. In 1922 he was appointed Superintendent of the Board of Health, which oversaw the new
        joint City-County Public Health Department. He also taught Public Health for many years at
        UNC-North Carolina and at Duke University's School of Medicine. Epperson retired in 1954
        after 36 years of service; he passed away in July 1958. </p>
      <p>During Epperson's administration the Durham Health Department grew from three employees to
        over fifty, and he led major county-wide campaigns against early 20th century infectious
        diseases such as tuberculosis, typhus, polio, and venereal disease; he also instituted
        sanitation practices for local milk production.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>Collection comprises correspondence, clippings, and photographs relating to the life and
        career of Dr. J. H. Epperson, from his appointment in 1915 to the newly-formed Durham, N.C.
        Department of Health to his death in 1958. Subjects in the many photocopied news clippings
        (1915-1958) center around Durham public health and sanitation history, including efforts by
        Epperson and his staff to establish regulations for the safe production of milk, and to
        combat typhus, polio, tuberculosis, venereal disease, and other infectious diseases among
        both white and African American populations in early 20th century Durham City and County. </p>
      <p>The correspondence chiefly consists of a few congratulatory exchanges between Epperson and
        Wilburt C. Davidson, Dean of the Duke University Medical School, where Epperson held a
        teaching position, and condolence letters to Epperson's widow. There is also one personal
        letter written by Epperson to his daughter and son-in-law.</p>
      <p>Also in the collection are 19 black-and-white photographs (1915-1958), chiefly 8x10 inch
          <title render="italic">Durham Herald-Sun</title> press photographs, whose subjects include
        early views of Durham, N.C., 1920s; interiors of the new Health Department laboratory in
        1915 with Epperson and staff; portraits of Epperson in his offices and at meetings; nurses
        and other staff, several of whom are people of color; and meeting and conference attendees,
        including a group attending a conference on preventing venereal disease. A nursing staff
        member who appears in several photographs with Epperson is an Elizabeth O'Kelly. Of note is
        a large 1920s group photograph of twenty local midwives, chiefly African American or
        multiracial, standing with Epperson and several staff on a flight of steps outside the
        Durham County Courthouse, where the Health Department was located.</p>

          <p>The photocopied clippings in this series offer many details on Jesse Epperson's career
            with the Durham, N.C. Health Department, including his leadership in campaigns to
            eliminate tuberculosis, typhus, polio, venereal disease (VD), and other infectious
            diseases, as well as the regulation of dairy production in the county. The clippings

          <p>The bulk of the photographs in this series were used to illustrate features in the
              <title render="italic">Durham Herald-Sun</title> newspaper. Although small in number,
            the photographs cover a wide range of decades, starting with three views of interiors of
            the Health Department labs (circa 1916), and a few images of downtown Durham, N.C.
            (1920). Editorial notes and occasional titles are penciled on the print versos. Of
            special interest is a large photograph dating from the 1920s of a large group of
            Durham-area midwives, mostly African American or multi-racial women, posed with Epperson
            and several of his staff. The photographs generally measure 8x10 inches.</p>

            <p>Photograph of a group of 20 Durham, North Carolina area midwives, posed standing in
              three rows on a flight of outside steps. From the architectural details, this is
              almost certainly the Old County Courthouse (built 1916), site of the Health Department
              offices. The midwives, mostly older women, are dressed in white caps and long aprons,
              and there are many cloth bundles, possibly their traveling supplies, on the steps
              surrounding the group. With the exception of one or two individuals, the midwives
              appear to be African American or mixed race women. </p>
            <p>In the top back row, also standing, are Dr. Jesse Epperson, Health Department
              Superintendent, Elizabeth O'Kelly, the Department's chief nurse, and an unidentified
              female who appears to be African American, in civilian dress. From the style of Dr.
              Epperson's suit, the date appears to be sometime in the later 1920s.</p>
            <p>On the back of the print is penciled, "Midwives - once an institution," and press

            <p>One small photograph is of nurse Elizabeth O'Kelly, on staff at the Durham Department
              of Health, standing with Jesse Epperson in an unspecified outdoor location, dated
              1933. She also appears in the photograph of the Durham midwives. A larger circa 1920s
              photograph is of a group of men, possibly part of a meeting; a label on the print
              reads "Dubois / The Stevens."</p>

            <p>The majority of these are Durham Herald-Sun press photographs of Epperson in his
              office or at meetings, with other individuals, and with staff. Some are captioned. One
              is of a group of attendees for a meeting on combatting venereal disease held in
              Durham, N.C. The last few are of Epperson's funeral procession, July 1954.</p>
