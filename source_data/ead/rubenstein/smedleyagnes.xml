         <abstract id="aspace_3381f3d64077d31c6453f1e5a8f3ed3d">Agnes Smedley was a journalist,
            writer, and left-wing activist remembered for her activity on behalf of the Communist
            cause in China during the 1930s. It is believed that she engaged in extensive espionage
            activities while she lived in Shanghai from 1929-1941. The Agnes Smedley letters consist
            of three letters by Smedley, the first of which was written while she lived in Shanghai,
            and the second two while she lived at the Yaddo artists' colony during the 1940s. The
            first letter is a request for a social engagement, and the second two letters discuss
            the particulars of her political observations and writings while she lived and worked in
            China. </abstract>

         <p>Agnes Smedley was an American journalist, writer, and left-wing activist best known for
            her autobiographical novel "Daughter of Earth." She went on to publish seven books about
            China, many of which are sympathetic chronicles of the Communist cause during the
            Chinese Civil War. During World War I, Smedley worked on behalf of the independence of
            India from the United Kingdom. From 1929-1941, she lived and wrote in Shanghai. It is
            generally accepted that Smedley engaged in espionage on behalf of the Communist
            International and the Soviet Union during this period. Smedley has been called "one of
            the most prolific female spies of the 20th century." After leaving China, she returned
            to the United States and lived at the Yaddo writer's colony. She was officially accused
            of espionage in 1949, which prompted her relocation to the United Kingdom shortly before
            her death. Smedley also worked on behalf of various progressive social causes, and was
            an associate of both Margaret Sanger and Emma Goldman.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection consists of three letters written by Agnes Smedley; the first to a Miss
            Gates, and the second two addressed to Corporal James A. Frankel. The single-page
            autograph manuscript letter to Miss Gates is written on letterhead stationery with
            Smedley's Shanghai address identifying her as the "Correspondent of the Frankfurter
            Zeitung in China." She asks Miss Gates to have "tiffin or tea" with her and wonders "Do
            you ever have extra time to see strange people?" The second manuscript letter, two
            leaves with text on all four sides, is dated December 27th, 1944. It primarily concerns
            Emily Hahn's book "China To Me." Smedley writes, “Miss Hahn spent 9 years sleeping
            around in Shanghai ... When the Japs took Hong Kong she wrote that she would just have
            died had she gone to a concentration camp like other Americans. So she went to the Japs
            and said, 'I’m a bad girl.' So the Japs left her free and she fooled around with them in
            Hong Kong, drinking and carousing, while the bastards were killing our men... But we
            Americans find this 'hot stuff' and put it up as a best seller... Miss Hahn is a
            propagandist for the Chinese reaction. She’s never seen a Chinese Communist, yet she’s
            agitating against them in N.Y... She led a purely personal life in two Chinese port
            cities but now poses as an authority on political and military matters of China." The
            third letter, autograph typescript dated March 23d 1947, was originally enclosed in
            Frankel’s copy of Smedley's book Battle Hymn of China, and addresses Frankel's questions
            about the Xi'an Incident of 1936 and the capture of Chiang Kai-shek. Smedley directs
            Frankel to her article on the topic published in The Nation magazine, as well as "her
            book."</p>
