         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>This collection contains mainly business and personal letters, bills, and receipts of
            William D. Hardin and family, and William Henry Ragan, dealing for the most part with
            local affairs, including legal matters, retail merchandising, education, religion,
            politics, Masonry, flour milling, and farming. Volumes include four registers for common
            school districts in Guilford County, North Carolina, 1879-1895. school notebooks; minute
            book of Pleasant Garden Farmers' Alliance, No. 2195, of Guilford County; and a poll
            book, 1924, for Fentriss Precinct, Guilford County.</p>
         <p>Many of the bills and receipts deal with the merchansiding and manufacturing firms with
            which Hardin and Ragan were connected. They bought much from merchants in Richmond and
            northward. A number of items deal with guano imported from Peru. The legal papers,
            running from 1863 to 1920, consist mainly of Justice of the Peace summonses, affidavits,
            executions of judgment, powers of attorney, indentures, contracts to build and repair a
            stock fence betweem Randolph and Guilford counties, and deeds. The eight election papers
            deal with miscellaneous election matters, an item, circa 1884, lists congressional and
            other candidates. The 15 items of printed matter include an 1870 circular of the New
            Garden Boarding School, New Garden, North Carolina, an 1882 notice of a Guilford County
            Republican meeting, and an 1889 act of the North Carolina General Assembly to
            incorporate the Farmer's State Alliance. The 11 bound volumes range from 1879 to 1924.
            Four are registers for common school districts in Guilford County (1879-1895). One is a
            poll book (1924) for the Fentriss Precinct. There is another volume (1886-1889) used as
            a daybook and time book. </p>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>William D. Hardin was an activist Methodist layman, he served as Justice of the Peace
            during much, if not all, of the time from 1878 to 1901. He was church secretary and as a
            chairman of a church board in 1895, and was on a committee of the Guilford County
            Sabbath School Association. He seems for a time to have served on the school board and
            to have operated retail stores off and on. He was a Masonic Lodge secretary in 1872 and
            1875 and perhaps at other times as well. In 1896 and 1898 he was a tax list taker in
            Fentriss, North Carolina and was a register for political elections (time and place
            unknown). In 1891 and 1895 he was vice-president of the Pleasant Gardens Farmer's
            Alliance, No. 2195 of Guilford County. He was president of the Julian Milling Company of
            Jullian, North Carolina in 1899-1900.</p>
