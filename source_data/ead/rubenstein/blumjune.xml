         <p>Quoted from Blum's website:</p>
         <p>An artist and pioneer in getting women artists and their works exhibited in mainstream
            museums, June Blum was in the forefront of the women's art movement in NYC in the late
            1960s and early l970s. Her <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Female President
               Light Event</title> (l968-1969) helped raise the awareness of Long Island, N.Y.,
            artists and residents. As Curator of Contemporary Art at the Suffolk Museum, Stony
            Brook, N.Y. (l971-1975), she created the exhibit <title type="simple"
               render="doublequote">Unmanly Art,</title> the first in-house Museum-curated exhibit
            of women artists (1971-1972). Blum also coordinated <title type="simple"
               render="doublequote">Works on Paper,</title> a show for women artists at the Brooklyn
            Museum (1975), and began a series of portraits of women prominent in feminist circles,
            including Alice Neel and Betty Friedan (painted in 1977 as part of the Sister Chapel
            project). In 1975 she formed Women Artists Living in Brooklyn, and was a juror for the
            exhibit <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Washington to Washington,</title> held
            at the National Museum of Women in the Arts. In 1980, Blum formed the East Central
            Women's Caucus for Art, and initiated women's exhibits around the country. Blum, whose
            works have been exhibited nationwide, studied at Brooklyn College, Brooklyn Museum Art
            School, The Pratt Graphic Art Center, and the New School of Social Research. She created
            Women for Art to publish catalogs, and was a member of the N.Y. Professional Women
            Artists group. In addition, she was an original artist and member of the all-women
            Central Hall Artists Gallery. She was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2003 for her role in
            advancing the study of women in the arts.</p>
