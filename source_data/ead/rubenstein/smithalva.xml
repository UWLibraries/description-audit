      <p>Alva Carmichael Smith, businessman, managed the Southern Coal Company at Columbus, Georgia,
        from about 1911 until the early 1930s. He was active in politics in Columbus, where, in
        1941, he had been a member of the local executive committee of the Democratic Party for 22
        years. In 1942 he was elected a member of the executive committee for the state. Earlier he
        had been a delegate to several state political conventions (1906, 1912). He was also active
        in fraternal organizations - the Freemasons, Knights of Pythias, and Kiwanis, and he was a
        leader in the Historical Society of Columbus from its inception in 1915. His brother, Henry
        Clifford Smith, was mayor of Columbus during the 1930s.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>The correspondence consists of both incoming and outgoing letters that, although
            numerous, are not a complete file. These business letters date between 1913 and 1933,
            and are relatively abundant for 1917, 1919-1924, 1926, 1928, and 1930-1932. Since Smith
            was a middleman, his correspondence reveals aspects of the problems, not only of
            wholesalers, but also of the miners and shippers of coal and, on the other side, the
            consumers. The business began about 1911. In 1919 it handled 185 cars of coal between
            Januarary and September. Coal was purchased directly from the mines for spot cash.
            Letters about the nature and history of the business include those of: Sept. 20, 1919:
            April 9, 14, 1920; Feb. 27, 1922; and April 15, 1926.</p>
          <p>The correspondence usually concerns routine matters of purchasing, pricing, selling,
            and shipping. However, problems of the coal trade were discussed or mentioned with some
            frequency. Strikes were major or minor difficulties in 1917, 1919-1920, 1922 (see also
            May 2,1933), 1924, and 1927. The effects of the strikes were the usual topics, but
            occasionally labor-management problems (as on March 20,1922) and labor union activity
            were noted. One small mine near Birmingham tried to enhance its competitiveness and
            labor relations by means of profit-sharing (letter of March 2, 1923). Shortages of
            railroad cars were serious in 1917and 1919-1920. Early in the latter year the car supply
            was described as "the worst in Alabama history" and later as "the worst in the history
            of the coal business" (Oct. 15). </p>
          <p>Wartime requirements and postwar readjustments were occasionally noted. The influenza
            epidemic also affected the labor force in 1920. Economic distress was mentioned during
            the Great Depression, especially in 1932. There are a few communications from management
            associations: the Southeastern Coal Merchants Association (March 20, 23, 24, 1922), and
            the Southern Appalachian Coal Operators' Association (May 2, 1923).</p>
          <p>Some letters are addressed to Smith's sisters, Mary Elizabeth and Dovie.</p>
