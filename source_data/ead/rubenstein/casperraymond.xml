            major stationed in Southeast Asia during late World War II. Collection includes slides,
            negatives, and prints of Southeast Asia, the majority of which appear to have been taken
            by Major Raymond E. Casper. The slides have not been sleeved, but each box is fairly
            well-labeled. Many of the prints are dated 1945-1946. The photographs are scenes of
            everyday life in rural and urban India. They include historical sites and palaces,
            archeological sites, temples, holy men, tribes, parades, farmers, beggars, snake
            charmers, and animals such as cows and monkeys. There is also a small number of
            photographs and slides of Hiroshima, Japan, following the atomic bomb in August
            1945.</abstract>

         <p>Raymond E. Casper was a U.S. Army officer stationed in Southeast Asia in 1945 through at
            least 1946. He retired with the rank of captain in 1947.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>This collection consists of photographic slides, prints, and negatives, the majority of
            which apppear to have been taken by Casper during his time in Southeast Asia at the end
            of World War II. Slides and prints are open to research; the negatives are closed to use
            due to preservation concerns. However, prints of the collection's negatives are
            available in Folder 4 of Box 1.</p>
         <p>There are over 1300 slides in this collection, the vast majority being from India. Some
            include captions, but there are very few dates. The collection includes both
            black-and-white and color slides. The black-and-white slides correspond to the
            collection's prints and negatives. The color slides, although they appear to be amateur
            photography, do not appear to have correlating prints. It is not clear if all slides
            were taken by Casper, or if some were acquired as souvenirs during or after his
            travels.</p>
         <p>The photographic prints are entirely black-and-white photography, ranging in size
            between 2x3 to 5x7 inches. They are in good condition, many including Casper's captions
            with comments, locations, and dates for the image.</p>
         <p>The images in the collection consist largely of scenes from rural and urban life in
            Southeast Asia in the mid-1940s. Locations represented include the Karachi Air Base in
            Pakistan; Lalmonirhat, Bangladesh; Agra, Cooch Behar (Koch Bihar), Calcutta, Hyderabad,
            and Delhi, India; and Hiroshima, Japan. Includes at least two photographs of Mohatma
            Gandhi. Other notable scenes include holy men and priests; Hindu iconography and gods;
            temples and historic sites, including the Taj Mahal and the Jain temple in Calcutta; and
            archeological sites. Street scenes of everyday people include images of beggars, a leper
            colony, street doctors and dentists, farmers, water-carriers, snake charmers,
            launderers, barbers, rickshaws, and policemen. Also includes images of military bases
            and soldiers, including many images of Casper. Practices that are heavily documented
            include burning ghats, fuel production from cow manure, and funeral rites. There is also
            a small amount of photographs from Hiroshima, Japan, showing the devestation of the city
            following the atomic bomb.</p>
         <p>A small amount of slides are clearly from a different period of Casper's life. They are
            in color and have images of a family touring various landmarks in the Eastern United
            States, including Washington D.C., Luray Caverns, and other historic sites in Virginia.
            These images are undated.</p>
