        Amerine wrote to attack advances in Civil Rights made during the 1950s, noting that members
        of the white race were becoming second-class citizens because of the legislative work of the
        federal government and the Supreme Court, along with 3 letters supporting his writing. Other
        topics include Christianity, Communism, and foreign aid. There are two versions of "An Essay
        on Crackpotism." The majority of the essays feature manuscript corrections made in ink.
        There are also three letters written to Amerine, dated 1960 and written by local officials
        who endorsed his manuscript, THE FORCES OF DARKNESS, including Judge Walter P. Jones of the
        15th Judicial Circuit of Alabama; MacDonald Gallion, State Attorney General; and George
        Platt Waller, a retired U.S. Foreign Service officer. Copies of these three letters have
        been attached the longer version of "An Essay on Crackpotism." One essay has a mailing
        envelope attached. Several of the items have been stamped with messages such as "Remember
