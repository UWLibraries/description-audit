         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Morrie Camhi was born in New York City in 1928, a descendant of Greek Sephardic Jews,
            and died in 1999 in Petaluma, California, where he lived with his family. He majored in
            English Literature at UCLA, then went on to a career in commercial photography; in the
            late 1960s he sold his business and began focusing on documentary work and teaching
            photography at San Francisco's City College. His work has been exhibited at the San
            Francisco Museum of Modern Art and in Chicago and New York, as well as galleries and
            museums in Europe, Israel, Japan and New Zealand, and his photographs have also been
            published in many books and photography journals.</p>

         <p>Collection features 167 black-and-white prints of documentary photographer Camhi's work
            on five projects, two of which are inter-related: <title type="simple"
               render="doublequote">ADVantage,</title> a series of intimate portraits in their homes
            of individuals who have written personal want ads; <title type="simple"
               render="doublequote">Espejo</title> and <title type="simple" render="doublequote"
               >Farmworkers,</title> which explore the dimensions of Mexican American activism and
            the lives of undocumented farmworkers; Jews of Greece, a study of individual Jews living
            in various places in Greece; and <title type="simple" render="doublequote">The Prison

            California State Prison at Vacaville and their answers to the question Camhi posed to
            them about what they would like people to know about the prison experience. The gelatin
            silver prints range in size from 8.5x13.5 to 10.25x13.25 inches, with many in 16x20 inch
            mats.</p>

                  in 16x20 inch mats. The subjects are writers of personal ads, who Camhi contacted
                  after seeing the ads in the paper. Camhi wrote that he saw the personal ads as
                  distilled self-portraits and created his own photographic portraits of the authors
                  of the ads in their homes. The text of the personal ads appears with most

               <p>Camhi directed this two-year visual exploration of Mexican American life and
                  culture called <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Espejo,</title> and
                  invited five other documentary photographers to join him. The resulting body of
                  work was exhibited in Chicago and Oakland and published in book form in 1978.
                  Primarily working in New Mexico and California, Camhi shot Mexican-American
                  artists, sculptors, craftsmen and undocumented families at work and in their
                  homes. The prints measure from 7.75x12.25 to 11x14 inches, with most of them in
                  16x20 inch mats. Images taken by other project photographers are not included in

                  accompanied by material possessions such as tools of their trade. Prints range in

               <p>These portraits were taken over an 18-month period and feature inmates, families,
                  and prison staff from the California State Prison at Vacaville. Almost every image
                  is accompanied by a statement, written on the frame, in answer to Camhi's question
                  posed to his subjects: "What do you want people to know about the prison
                  experience?" The images led to two traveling exhibits as well as a book. Prints
                  measure 11x14 inches and are all in 16x20 inch mats. These photographs were
                  published in book form as <title type="simple" render="italic">The Prison
                     Experience</title> (1990).</p>

                  <p>Approximately 1,000 negatives in original sleeves. Subjects include Camhi's
                     images published in <title type="simple" render="italic">Breakthrough
                        Magazine</title>; trips to China, Ireland/England, Israel, and Paris; family
                     trips in the 1960s and many other images of his family; and a self-portrait.
                     Most negatives are medium format 60mm strips, but there are also many 35mm
                     negative strips and large format sheet film. In some cases there are also
                     positive contact strips mingled with the negative strips. Arranged in original
                     order as received.</p>

                  <p>Slides are both in sleeves and housed in small slide boxes. The boxes include
                     family photos, but also include images from Camhi's major projects -
                     Farmworkers, Ad:Vantage, Roadside, The Prison Experience, and Espejo. The
                     sheets of slides also include these works, but also feature Haiku (one of his
                     earliest projects), "Slavin," and Jews of Greece (JOG); titles are taken from
                     slide labels or boxes. Also includes an image of the artist Christo.</p>
