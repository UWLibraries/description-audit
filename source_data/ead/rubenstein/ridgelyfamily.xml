         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Collection comprises family documents. Includes a deed (29 July 1790) related to the
            dispute between Rebecca Ridgely and Charles Ridgely Carnan; a letter to Charles Carnan
            regarding a payment and receipts from a linen draper (1791); warrants issued during
            Charles Carnan Ridgeley's term as governor; and a "Ridgely notebook" (1892) that
            contains copied Ridgely family letters, genealogical information, and notes on family
            history and land holdings. Also contains Mrs. Ridgely's letters (1858 and undated) to
            her daughter, Eliza White, who was traveling in France with her children. The letters
            chiefly discuss family matters such as illness, births, weddings, child rearing, and
            household management. Mrs. Ridgely also writes about social life in Baltimore, her
            daughter's itinerary, and many requests for purchases from French and English
            merchants.</p>
         <p>There are documents with unclear connections to the Ridgely family, including an
            indenture (1838) between Charles Carroll III and Reuben Musgrove for rent of land on
            Doughoregan Manor (Ellicott City, in Howard County, Md.) and a copy of a Murray family
            tree (1850s).</p>
