        volume (170 pages) written in several hands that was probably passed among the generations
        in the Stennett family; probably from Joseph Stennett to Samuel; there is a notation on p.
        11 that the volume was passed from Samuel Stennett to E[lizabeth] Stennett, his daughter, in
        1795. The volume contains religious materials, primarily hymns and poetry, including hymns
        by Samuel Stennett (beginning p. 53), along with some verse. A few pieces are in Latin, and
        many pieces are tied to Biblical verses. Corrections and additions to the text are
