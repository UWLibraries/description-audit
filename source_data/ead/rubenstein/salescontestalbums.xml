      <abstract id="aspace_9be3d9d9f155830bf35b287f54ca5d3e">Collection comprises two photograph
        albums documenting manufacturer's sales promotion contests administered by various
        newspapers in the U.S. northeast, primarily in Pennsylvania. The contests required
        participants to amass "votes" by collecting labels or wrappers from designated products to
        be turned in to the newspaper offices. Photographs depict newspaper advertisements
        announcing the contests, collections of wrapper submissions, correspondence relating to the
        contest and other activities. Newspapers documented include the Advocate, Cleveland News,
        Philadelphia Record, Pittsburgh Post-Sun, and Sunday News Leader. D.J. Wattis, at one time
        of the Pittsburgh Post-Sun Advertising Department is featured several times in conjunction
        with the contests. Designated consumer products represent regional and national brands and
        include Barbasol, Foulds, Keebler, Lautz Brothers (Snow Boy), Post and Postum cereals,
        Salada Tea and Woolson Spice Company (Golden Sun Coffee). Acquired as part of the John W.
