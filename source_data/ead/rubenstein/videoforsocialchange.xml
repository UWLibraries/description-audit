            <p>Angaza Laughinghouse is a founder of the political organization Black Workers for
              Justice based in Raleigh, North Carolina. Laughinghouse first got involved in activism
              in New York where he grew up, before moving to North Carolina after hearing about the
              Charlotte Three and the Wilmington Ten. He began community and workplace organizing
              after the Greensboro Massacre. Black Workers for Justice came to be as a result of
              protests against unfair treatment of female workers at a K-Mart in Rocky Mount. The
              organization strives to empower workers to stand up for their own needs both in the
              workplace and in the community. They have also been active in political campaigns and
              have had members run for office. -- Description adapted from interview abstract (see

            <p>Allison Riggs is a staff attorney for the Southern Coalition for Social Justice who
              focuses mainly on voting rights. Riggs grew up in Morgantown, West Virginia and
              received her undergraduate and graduate education from the University of Florida. In
              her interview, she discusses her current work on voting rights and issues surrounding
              redistricting, Section 5 of the Civil Rights Act of 1965 in the state of North
              Carolina, and the impact that Supreme Court cases regarding voting legislation have
              had on North Carolina and the country as a whole. She also discusses other problematic
              discriminatory occurrences in North Carolina, such as police discrimination and
              profiling, and the subsequent collateral damages that occur from these practices. --
