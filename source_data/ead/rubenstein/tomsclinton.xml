         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Clinton White Toms was born in 1868 in Hertford, North Carolina. He graduated from the
            University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill at age 21, and became a principal at a
            Durham high school. In 1894, he became Superintendant of Schools in Durham. He was soon
            wooed by the Duke family, and left the education system to become a manager at American
            Tobacco's Durham plant. Following the breakup of the company, Toms joined the newly
            formed Liggett &amp; Myers as a vice president and as a board member in 1911. In 1928,
            he was elected president of the company. He remained president until his death in
            1936.</p>
         <p>Toms was also a generous philanthropist and benefactor to many North Carolina charities
            and organizations. He served as a trustee of Duke University from 1901-1932. He and his
            wife, Mary Newby Toms, had seven children, six of whom lived to adulthood. Toms is
            buried in Maplewood Cemetary in Durham, North Carolina.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection consists of a 13x15 inch scrapbook, unbound, containing 19 double-sided
            pages. The book includes materials from Toms' memorial service and death, including
            letters of condolence (all within their original envelopes), calling cards, newspaper
            clippings, church bulletins, and obituaries. It appears to have been accumulated and
            assembled by Mrs. Mary Toms Erwin, one of Toms' daughters, as she is the main recipient
            of the condolence notes.</p>
         <p>Also pasted in the scrapbook are letters and newspaper articles regarding the deaths of
            Clinton Toms' wife, Mary Newby Toms, in 1925, and his son, George, in 1926. Toms is
            usually acknowledging or thanking doctors or other friends for their kindness during
            those tragedies. The newspaper articles tend to discuss scholarships or other donations
            Toms has made in honor of his lost family members.</p>
