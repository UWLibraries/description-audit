         <abstract id="aspace_3e3a5b860c6d172ce6fd4cdae68dcf29">George McClellan Derby (1856-1948)
            was a U.S. Army engineer recognized for his aerial balloon assents and reconnaissance
            efforts during the Santiago de Cuba campaign of the Spanish-American War. For the
            majority of his military career, he was involved in river engineering projects
            throughout the United States. The collection includes letters to George McClellan Derby,
            letters to his wife, Bessie (Kidder) Derby, and several letters written by Derby to his
            mother. Over 50 letters are grouped by originator within the George McClellan Derby
            series, 29 of which pertain to Derby's military career, mainly in relation to his
            responsibilities as Assistant Engineer in charge of New York river and harbor works
            during the mid-1880s. Nearly 90 letters, written by Derby's friend and uncle-in-law,
            Clarence F. Low, are arranged chronologically by year within the Clarence F. Low series.
            The collection, chiefly personal in nature, offers insights into the private life of
            this prominent military engineer and an indication of the challenges involved in
            conducting underwater explosions. Materials range in date from 1874 to 1907, 1924, and
            undated.</abstract>

               <p>The series includes more than 80 letters to Derby or to his wife from her uncle,
                  Clarence F. Low, the Resident Secretary of the New Orleans office of Liverpool
                  &amp; London &amp; Globe Insurance Company of England. Although written or typed
                  on company letterhead paper, most of the letters are personal, revealing a
                  fatherly love and concern for his niece, whom he called Marjorie, and for Derby,
                  his friend and son-in-law as of 1904. Many are signed <emph render="doublequote"
                     >Nunkie.</emph> Letters dating from late 1906 to early 1907 provide regular
                  accounts of the Derby's young son, George Townsend, who resided with Low in New
                  Orleans while Derby and his wife vacationed in Italy.</p>
