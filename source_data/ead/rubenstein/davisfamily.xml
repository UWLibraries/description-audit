         <p>The Davis family of Hampton, Virginia traces its history back to William Roscoe Davis, a
            former slave and religious and civic leader in Hampton, who lived from 1812 to 1904. The
            children of his son Andrew Davis and Frances Nash were: Oma Davis, William Davis, Thomas
            H. Davis, Don Andrew Davis, Harry Winfred Davis, John Davis, Collis Huntington Davis,
            and Arthur Paul Davis, and Nancy Davis. Don Davis was an administrator at Hampton
            Institute in Hampton, Virginia.</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="bold">Arthur Paul Davis, Sr.</emph>
         </p>
         <p>Arthur P. Davis (1904-1996) was born and raised in Hampton, Virginia. A Phi Beta Kappa,
            he received a degree in philosophy from Columbia University in 1927 and briefly taught
            at North Carolina College for Negroes (later North Carolina Central University) before
            returning to Columbia to earn a master's degree in English in 1929. For fifteen years he
            taught at Virginia Union University and in 1942 earned his Ph.D. in 18th-century English
            literature from Columbia, the first black American to do so. He joined Howard University
            in 1944 where he taught until 1980 and was part of a legendary faculty that included
            Sterling Brown, Ralph Bunche, E. Franklin Frazier, Mordecai Johnson, Alain Locke, and
            James Nabrit, among others. His books <title type="simple" render="italic">The Negro
               Caravan</title> (1941), <title type="simple" render="italic">Cavalcade: Negro
               American Writers from 1760 to the Present</title> (1971), <title type="simple"

            <emph render="bold">Georgia Campbell Neal</emph>
         </p>
         <p>Georgia Campbell Neal (1889-1972) was born in Yazoo City, Mississippi. She attended Fisk
            University and Rust College. She moved to Nebraska to study at hte Graduate School of
            Pharmacy at Creighton unviersity completing her degree in 1909. Her fourth husband James
            McKinley Neal was also a pharmacist, and the first African American elected into the
            state legislature. Together they owned the Regal Pharmacy in Kansas City, Missouri which
            her husband continued to operate until his own death in 1982. Georgia's only
            child,Willie Louise Barbour, was born in 1906.</p>

            <emph render="bold">Collis Huntington Davis, Sr.</emph>
         </p>
         <p>Collis Huntington Davis, Sr. was born in 1900 in Hampton, Virginia and attended the
            Whittier School and Hampton Institute Academy. He was one of the first African American
            students to attend Grinnell College in Iowa and in 1923 became the first African
            American Grinnell student to be inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. He returned to Hampton
            Institute as a chemistry instructor in 1923. He did graduate work at Harvard University
            and earned a master's degree in chemistry from Columbia University. He pursued a P.h.D.
            in chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania but did not complete the work. He served
            as chemistry department head and later as Dean of Students, Registrar, Dean of
            Admissions, and administrative assistant to the president of the Institute. After 47
            years, Collis Davis retired from Hampton Institute in 1971. He died in 1974.</p>

            <emph render="bold">Willie (Billie) Louise Barbour Davis</emph>
         </p>
         <p>Billie Davis was born Willie Louise Barbour in 1906 in Kansas City, Missouri. She earned
            a degree from Sargent Physical Education School in Boston, Massachusetts (now part of
            Boston University). During her college studies she met Collis H. Davis, who was enrolled
            in a summer class at Harvard University. After graduation she moved to Virginia to teach
            dance and physical education at Hampton Institute, and in 1930 married Collis Davis. In
            addition to dance, Billie developed an interest in photography. She studied with the
            Hampton photography instructor, Reuben Burrell, and built a darkroom in her home. When
            physical ailments curtailed her dance activity, she concentrated on her photography for
            the remainder of her life, expanding her range with experimental techniques. She died in
            1955. The playground that she worked to build in Phoebus, Virginia was dedicated to her
            in 1980.</p>

         <p>Georgia Louise, the Davis' first child, was born in 1932 and was known as Louise. The
            Davis children grew up on the grounds of Hampton Institute and attended the Institute's
            George P. Phenix School. In twelfth grade, instead of graduating from Phenix School,
            Louise enrolled in Fryeburg Academy, in Fryeburg, Maine. She was the first African
            American student at the institution. At the recommendation of her cousin, Charles T.
            Davis of New York University, Louise participated in the Encampment for Citizenship
            program in Bronx, New York in the summer of 1949. Louise attended Colby College,
            Waterville, Maine from autumn 1949 through spring 1953 and earned a B.A. degree in
            sociology. After graduation, she moved to New York City and attended Columbia University
            for one year. She subsequently worked in advertising for four companies in New York
            City. Louise married the journalist Charles Sumner Stone, Jr. in 1958, and their first
            child, Krishna, was born in 1959. The family lived in the Bronx until 1961 when they
            moved to Washington, D.C. Their second child, Allegra, was born in 1962. Louise wrote
            jazz and theater columns for the <title type="simple" render="italic">Washington
               Afro-American</title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">Washington

               type="simple" render="italic">The Players Showcase</title> magazine. The Stones'
            third child, Charles Stone III, was born in Washington, D.C. in 1966. The Stone family
            moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1971 where Chuck Stone was a columnist for the
               <title type="simple" render="italic">Philadelphia Daily News</title>. Louise
            occasionally wrote essays for the column. The family moved to North Carolina in 1991
            when Chuck Stone accepted a position in the Journalism Department at the University of
            North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Louise worked at the University of Pennsylvania, the
            University of Delaware, and then at the NC Dept. of Labor in Raleigh as director of
            publications.</p>

            an Ed.D. at Rutgers University in 1980. She followed a career in Social Services working
            primarily with juveniles. Jennie Davis made many contributions to the field including,
            developing one of the first alternative detention models and founding the organization
            "People for Prisoner Art" in New Jersey. </p>

               <p>Series comprises six photograph albums of the Davis family. One photograph album
                  was created by Georgia Campbell Neal and includes images from 1924 through the
                  1950s that document her life in Kansas City, Missouri where she and her husband
                  James McKinley Neal, both pharmacists, owned the Regal Pharmacy. Other subjects
                  include her daughter, Billie Louise Barbour, and her grandchildren, Georgia Louise
                  Davis, Jennie Davis, Collis Davis, Jr., and Thulani Davis. Four photograph albums
                  created by Louise Davis include snapshots mostly taken by her or her mother that
                  document Louise's life in Hampton, Virginia and her later activities, particularly
                  her attendance at Fryeburg Academy (1947-1949), the Encampment for Citizenship
                  summer program (1949), and Colby College (1949-1953). The majority of the images
                  are in black and white. Some photographs including those taken in Jamaica, Burma,
                  and India were presented to Louise Davis by friends upon their return from visits.
                  Finally, the sixth item is a wedding album of photographs from Louise Davis'
                  marriage to Chuck Stone in 1958.</p>
               <p>Processing note: Overhead photocopies were made of each photograph album page to
                  preserve original order and to allow for donor annotations. The photograph albums
                  are not bound; the individual pages are encased in mylar sleeves.</p>
