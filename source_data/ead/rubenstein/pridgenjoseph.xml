         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Joseph Davis Pridgen, Jr. was a native of Durham, NC. Prior to his enlistment, Pridgen
            worked as a teller at First National Bank in downtown Durham. In the service, Pridgen
            was a supply sergeant with Company M, 120th U.S. Infantry, 30th Division during World
            War I. Along with soldiers from North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee, Pridgen
            trained at Camp Sevier outside of Greenville, South Carolina from August 1917 until his
            Division's embarkation to France in May 1918. After the war Pridgen owned and operated
            an automobile dealership in Durham.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Chiefly letters written by Pridgen to his mother, father, sister, and an occassional
            family friend while serving with Company M, 120th U.S. Infantry, 30th Division, commonly
            referred to as the <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Old
            Hickory</title>Division, of the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I.</p>
         <p>Letters of August 1917 through May 1918 primarily describe his life at Camp Sevier:
            meals, discipline, pay, his duties as supply sergeant, and the arrival of new
            conscripts. He also describes several episodes of desertion, a measles outbreak and
            resulting medical quarantine, and soldiers suffering from pneumonia and spinal
            meningitis. Other topics include occassional trips into Greenville and Spartanburg where
            he and other soldiers were hosted by local families, attended picture shows, including
               <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Birth of a Nation,</title>, and fraternized
            with other soldiers.</p>
         <p>Letters of May 1918 through July 1918 describe preparations for his division's
            embarkation to France. He notes the transfer of his division to Camp Merritt, New Jersey
            and stops along the way in Washington, D.C and Philadelphia, PA where Red Cross women
            handed out post cards, fresh apples and cigarettes to the troops. He also describes
            nights out in New York City, NY and a visit to the Kinney-Duke branch of the American
            Tobacco Co. with other soldiers from Durham. Letters of July 1918 warn recipients of
            future cencorship of letters. There is also a postcard of July 1918 with an image of his
            division's transport ship and date of embarkation.</p>
         <p>Letters of August 1918 through November 1918 describe active duty in France. Due to
            censorhip of letter content, most letters are relatively consice and his exact
            whereabouts are never disclosed. However, he does describe his duties behind the lines
            assisting a mess sergeant, transportation of food to soldiers at the front, some
            references to conditions, and, due to the potential presence of German aircraft, a
            strict lights-out policy after dark. He also briefly describes duties at the front
            including a nineteen day stint in the trenches and the deaths of several soldiers
            including a friend from Durham. He also describes coursework at an engineers training
            school where he completed classes on camouflage, gas, mining and pioneering, and
            bridging. His notebooks from these courses are present in the collection.</p>
         <p>After the armistice his letters touch on a variety of topics including descriptions of
            holiday dinners in camp, his transfer out of the 30th Division, rumors surrounding which
            divisions will sail home first, and the influenza outbreak in the United States. After
            his division's transfer to Le Mans, France prior to embarkation he describes his
            anxiousness to return to the States, his observations of French people, attending a
            baseball game and his disillusionament with the Y.M.C.A., noting the arrest of two staff
            members for stealing money.</p>
         <p>The collection also contains some military papers and ephemera including several General
            Orders, cartoon clippings from a Camp Sevier newspaper--one of which depicts Pridgen,
            assorted print material including a pamphlet on recent military operations, divisional
            shoulder patches, and a tag with Pridgen's name and division number. Also present is a
            small amount of legal and financial papers relating to Pridgen's automobile dealership
            opened after the war and assorted clippings from World War I and several documenting
            post-war commemorations.</p>
