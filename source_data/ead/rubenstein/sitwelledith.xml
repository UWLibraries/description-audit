      <abstract id="aspace_73dd51058b27f667680918359578b5af">Dame Edith Sitwell was a British poet
        and critic whose work helped usher in the modernist era of British poetry. This autograph
        manuscript contains the text of two of her poems: "Lullaby" and "Serenade: From Any Man to
        Any Woman." Both poems were inspired by the early years of World War II and were published
        in her 1942 collection "Street Songs."</abstract>

      <p>Edith Sitwell was a British writer and critic who was named Dame Commander of the OBE. Her
        two younger brothers, Osbert and Sacheverell, were literary figures in their own right. The
        Sitwell family had aristocratic origins, but Edith had an unhappy home life and was closer
        to her governess than to her parents. Sitwell suffered from complications related to Marfan
        Syndrome, but used her height to dramatic advantage with her manner of dress and style,
        particularly when giving readings. She said of herself, "I am not eccentric. It's just that
        I am more alive than most people. I am an unpopular electric eel in a pool of catfish."
        Although her prose was commercially successful, she is chiefly known for her poetry, which
        challenged the stylistic conventions of her day and helped usher British poetry into the
        modernist age. Sitwell befriended and promoted younger poets and their work, including Dylan
        Thomas. She was intimately involved with the British literary intelligensia of the early to
        mid 20th century. When she converted to Catholicism late in life, Evelyn Waugh served as her
        godfather.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The five leaf holograph manuscript with text on the front side of each numbered page
        consists of two poems both titled at the top and signed "Edith" at the bottom. Both poems,
        "Lullaby," and "Serenade: Any Man to Any Woman" appeared in her 1942 collection "Street
        Songs." In this manuscript, "Serenade" is titled "Any Man to Any Woman." Both were inspired
        by the early years of World War II and are ironically titled. "Lullaby," sung by a baboon,
        describes a chaotic, primeval world destroyed by wartime chaos and despair in which, "All is
        equal - blindness, sight/There is no depth, there is no height." "Serenade" spoken by a
        dying soldier, regards his love through the lens of death and destruction. He identifies his
        love with a cannon and invites her to "die with me and be my love" in a reversal of the
        famous Marlowe line. </p>
