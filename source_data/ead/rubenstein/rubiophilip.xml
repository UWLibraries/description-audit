      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Taken from http://diversity.duke.edu/news/profiles/rubio.php</p>
      <p>Philip Rubio was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1950. He moved to Durham, North
        Carolina in 1988 and worked full-time for the post office from 1980-2000. During that time,
        he earned a bachelor's degree through Vermont College's distance-learning program and earned
        a master's degree from North Carolina Central University in 1998.</p>
      <p>In 2000, Rubio took early retirement from the Postal Service and entered Duke's graduate
        program in history. He received his Ph.D. in 2006. From 2003-2007, he taught as a teaching
        fellow and adjunct instructor at the Center for Documentary Studies. He currently serves as
        Assistant Professor of History at North Carolina A&amp;T State University.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The collection includes 29 audiocassette tapes, one CD, 20 tapelogs, one transcription and
        30 signed permission slips from oral history interviews conducted by Rubio for his
        dissertation, "There's Always Work at the Post Office: African Americans Fight for Jobs,
        Justice, and Equality at the United States Post Office, 1940-1971" (published in book form
        in 2010 by the University of North Carolina Press). </p>
      <p>Between 2004 and 2009, Rubio interviewed 31 current and retired postal workers who had
        worked at post offices in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Mississippi,
        Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Washington, DC. The interviews focus on the
        significance of post office work in the black community and the black-led fight against the
        white supremacy at the post office as well as within its unions. They also dwell on union
        politics, relations between postal unions, postal working conditions, workplace and
        community activism, and the Great Postal Wildcat Strike of 1970.</p>
      <p>Those interviewed were as follows (some interviewed together): Countee Abbott, John Adams
        and Dorothea Hoskins, Sam Armstrong and Samuel Lovett, Eleanor Bailey, Joann Flagler,
        Frederick John, Carlton Tilley and Gregory Wilson, Felix Bell, Sr., William H. Burrus, Jr.,
        Don Cantriel, Joseph Henry, Douglas C. Holbrook, Jimmy Mainor, Al Marino, Frank Orapello and
        Vincent Sombrotto, Raydell Moore, Cleveland Moore, James Morris, Noel Murrain, James Newman,
        Jeff Perry and Richard Thomas, D. James Pinderhughes, George Booth Smith, Donald P. Stone,
        Daisy Strachan, and Tommie L. Wilson. </p>
      <p>Typed tapelogs and one transcription accompany these interviews. Use copies will need to be
        made for researchers prior to use.</p>
      <p>This collection was acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin Center for African American
        History and Culture.</p>
