         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>From the captions and a few dated images, it is likely that these photographs of the
            Afghan Wars were taken by a British photographer, and represent a period during summer
            and fall of 1897, when there was a major outbreak of hostilities between native Afghanis
            in the Mamund Valley against British and Indian army troops. The total loss of British
            men was about 200 out of a force of about 1200. The operation in the Mamund Valley ended
            in January 1897.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Collection of glossy black and white photographic prints of Afghanistan, taken by an
            anonymous photographer during the Afghan Wars, most likely in summer and fall 1897
            during which there was a major outbreak of hostilities. The images consist of 24 8.125"
            x 5.75" prints, and 21 smaller 4.125" x 5.75" prints, all affixed to cardstock, three or
            four per page, often on both sides of the board. There is also a panoramic shot of the
            Tungai Pass made up of three sequenced prints. Pasted-down typed captions are also
            present for some images, while others carry handwritten captions; a few are dated 1897.
            The set was originally housed in an unmarked cloth and board portfolio, which has also
            been conserved. Resembling to some degree in subject matter the Afghanistan images of
            military photographer R. B. Holmes, the majority of the images in this collection depict
            British military camps and landscapes. The landscape views include the Mamund Valley,
            Tangi Pass, Agrah, Chakdara, Malakand, and Ambeyla Pass, and a few captions describe
            events taking place in that location. Military camps, many taken at a distance with fine
            detail, include Buner, Inayat Killa, Kindergali, and Malakand. A few scenes show
            bridges, including a boat bridge over the Indus. Some prints feature groups of officers
            in posed and casual scenarios, including one image of the First Royal West Kent
            Regiment. One image shows the gravesite of 2nd Lieutenant W. C. Browne-Clayton, dated
            Sept. 30, 1897, killed at the battle of Agrah. Acquired as part of the Archive of
            Documentary Arts.</p>
