      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The course introduces students to methods of archival research and investigates the archive
        as a tool for creative and scholarly use within documentary practice. Using Duke’s
        Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript library students gained practical experience to
        effectively locate, retrieve, handle, document and analyze primary source materials. This
        knowledge was then applied to produce original written and multimedia documentary projects
        that rethink notions of history, identity, memory, and loss. The class also explored
        individual and open source archives, as well as works by contemporary artists and
        documentarians who mediate archival materials and structures. The course emphasis is to
        encounter the archive as a site of discovery and construction.</p>

            <p>Hopkins' abstract: “This work explores the practice of extra-illustration, or
              grangerization: the act of supplementing the illustrative content of a book with
              additional images, prints, drawings, ect. not found in the original work. For my
              project I have extra-illustrated the 1961 edition of William Faulkner’s Selected Short
              Stories which I discovered in a used book store in downtown Durham. The book has been
              extra-illustrated with 7 images from various collections related to Faulkner housed in
              the Rubenstein Library as well as one original illustration on the title page.”</p>

              papers on women and psychiatric treatment, to give a clear voice to those who have

            <p>Rubin's abstract: “Design for a Duchess was published by Duke University’s Social
              Standards Committee from 1954-1963 and was sent out to all incoming freshman girls.
              The pamphlet was meant to welcome them to Duke, but more importantly it gave specific
              instructions about traditions and behavioral standards that they would be expected to
              uphold during their time at Duke. The publication uses the idea of a “Duchess” as a
              model of good manners and grace, the supposed ultimate goal of every young woman
              entering the University. My modern version of Design for a Duchess is a satire of the
              original and an examination of the implicit beauty and behavioral standards that women
              at Duke are still affected by in 2015. It is written as if it were to be distributed
              to the women of the class of 2016 and on.”</p>
            <p>Inspired by Design for a Duchess, part of the Freshman Life Reference Collection in
              University Archives.</p>

            <p>Smith's abstract: No sight but thine and mine is an experimental short-form
              documentary revealing the nature of ocular prosthetic technology housed at Duke
              University. In the History of Medicine Collections, resides a mysterious box of
              antique prosthetic glass eyes of unknown origin and purpose. These eyes are beautiful,
              but serve no function for the wearer. On the other side of campus, at the Duke Eye
              Center, patients are receiving cutting-edge prosthetic implants that are allowing
              those who’ve lost their sight to see the world in a completely new way that those of
              us with traditional sight are unable to replicate. The title is drawn from Act 1,
              Scene 2 of William Shakespeare’s The Tempest – part of the line which marks the first
              use of the word ‘eyeball’ in recorded history.</p>

            <p>Thomas's abstract: A Fixed Facsimile is an experimental documentary film examining
              the extent that physically and digitally archived works of text can be captured and
              presented in the form of moving images using simple machines without electricity to
              mimic the conditions under which the content was first created. Both the physical
              artifact and the digitally archived version of The Mathematical and Philosophical
              Works of the Right Reverend John Wilkins, originally published in 1708, were
              photographed on a Bolex 16mm camera with a disengaged motor. Documentation of the
              actual book is paired with images of its digital interface to create a feedback loop
              in the genealogy of new media and forms of communication, as older ones like the book
              itself are literally falling apart.</p>
            <p>The fluttering exposures were achieved by cranking the film through the camera’s gate
              by hand at a rate of 1/4 to 1/8 of a second. The film was then processed and allowed
              to dry with the fixer still on the film, creating crystallized textures upon the
              images. </p>
            <p>Incorporates images from the book: The mathematical and philosophical works of the
              Right Reverend John Wilkins by John Wilkins</p>
