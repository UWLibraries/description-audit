         <abstract id="aspace_bed5412d01f5909ac966c74fff254426">Pearl S. Buck was an American writer
            best known for her depictions of rural Chinese life. Her bestselling novel The Good
            Earth was awarded the Pulizer Prize, and she was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize
            in Literature (1938). This letter is written by Buck to Frances Perkins, then Franklin
            D. Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor, the first woman to hold a cabinet post. Buck thanks
            Perkins for congratulating her on winning the Nobel Prize. She writes that the award,
            "was given as much to America and China as it was to me." </abstract>

         <p>Pearl S. Buck was an American writer who was the daughter of missionaries and spent most
            of her early life in China. She is known as the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning
            bestselling novel The Good Earth (1932). Buck was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize
            for Literature in 1938 for, "her rich and truly epic descriptions of peasant life in
            China and for her biographical masterpieces." Buck's work helped demystify China to the
            American public. She also did a great deal of humanitarian work, particularly in the
            areas of women's rights, adoption, immigration, and peace. </p>
         <p>Frances Perkins was an Amiercan sociologist and workers-rights advocate who was the
            first woman appointed to the U.S. Cabinet. She served Franklin D. Roosevelt as the U.S.
            Secretary of Labor from 1933-1945.</p>

         <p>The collection consists of a single autograph typescript letter from the author Pearl S.
            Buck to the U.S. Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins. Perkins had written to Buck to
            congratulate her for winning the Nobel Prize in Literature for 1938. Buck responds, "It
            is very kind of you indeed to write me as you have about the Nobel Prize. It adds a
            great deal to the pleasure of this award, which I cannot but feel was given as much to
            America and China as it was to me." Buck's return address is given as "209 The Manor,
            333 E. 43rd Street, New York City."</p>
