        art historian and author residing in Durham, North Carolina. Collection comprises materials
        relating to two research projects conducted by Mathews: one on Roger Fenton, lawyer and
        early English photographer; and a later project on African American sculptor Richmond
        Barthé. The Fenton series includes letters (1940s-1950s) from Fenton descendants, many of
        which comment on the aftermath of the war; images of the family home, Crimble Hall in
        Rochdale, England; photographs of Fenton and his family (1860s); and modern copies of his
        own photographs (1850s). The Barthé papers consist of a draft biography by Mathews, and 134
        photographs of his sculptures and other artwork, as well as early portraits of Barthé and
        his family, and were acquired by the John Hope Franklin Research Center for African and
        African American History and Culture. Although Barthé had relationships with men over his
        lifetime, the biography appears to make no overt mention of his sexuality. The collection
        also includes a large scrapbook for the year 1939 containing U.S. news stories and articles
        about the war and on Fascism in the U.S.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Marcia M. Mathews (1904-1990) was a Georgia-born art historian and author who resided in
        Atlanta, Georgia, and in Durham, N.C. until her death. She taught art history at Duke in the
        1930s, and was married to Joseph James Mathews, European history professor whose papers are
        also in the Duke collections. In addition to her research on Roger Fenton, she wrote
        articles and monographs on African American artists, including Henry Ossawa Tanner and
        Marian Anderson; her biography of artist Richmond Barthé is unpublished.</p>
      <p>Roger Fenton (1819-1869) was born in Lancashire, Rochdale Borough, and resided at his
        family's ancestral home, Crimble Hall. He studied law and art, then in the 1850s turned to
        photography, experimenting with the wet collodion process, then in its infancy. He took many
        photographs of the Crimean War, thus becoming one of the world's first war photographers.
        Fenton was a founder of the Royal Photographic Society and its first honorary secretary.
        Queen Victoria was one of his patrons: he photographed her family and attended royal
        audiences where he described his experiences in the Crimea.</p>
      <p>Richmond Barthé, or James Richmond Barthé, was born in Mississippi in 1901, and died in
        Pasadena, California in 1989. After studying at the Art Institute of Chicago, he went on to
        become a sculptor; he also painted. Barthé had several relationships with men during his
        lifetime. He resided in several places through his career: New York City; Jamaica, where he
        bought a home; Florence, Italy; and then Southern California. At a time when African
        American artists were underrepresented in American academies and galleries, he won many
        awards and became one of the first African American artists to be represented in the
        Metropolitan Museum of Art's permanent collections.</p>

      <head>Content Description</head>
      <p>The papers of author and art historian Marcia M. Mathews comprise materials chiefly
        relating to two research projects: Mathew's search for material on Roger Fenton, a mid-19th
        century lawyer and early photographer; and an unpublished typescript and photographs
        relating to her research on African American sculptor Richmond Barthé. Other materials
        include a large war scrapbook for the year 1939 with many articles and clippings about
        Fascism in the U.S., and a biographical sketch of her career.</p>
      <p>The Roger Fenton series consists chiefly of Mathews' research materials and sketches
        relating to Fenton, and correspondence (1940s-1950s) between Mathews and Fenton descendants.
        The series concludes with a group of a dozen photographs, including cartes-de-visite of his
        family and 20th century copies of Roger Fenton's 1850s photographs of the Crimean War, the
        south front of the Kremlin, three of Queen Victoria's children, and a landscape with a
        bridge. There is also a photograph and a photo of a sketch of Crimble Hall, the family seat
        in Rochdale, England.</p>
      <p>Materials on Richmond Barthé consist of Marcia Mathews' unpublished typescript draft
        biography (circa 1975), covering Barthé's entire life and career up to age 75. Although he
        was known to have had a number of relationships with men over his lifetime, the biography
        appears to make no overt mention of his sexuality. </p>
      <p>The 134 photographs in the Barthé series are chiefly black-and-white images of his most
        important sculptures and other artwork, with several early family portraits of Barthé, his
        mother, and stepfather (circa 1915, 1935, and circa 1940). Subjects of the sculptures are
        most frequently Black figure studies, including African characters; busts of well-known
        African Americans such as Booker T. Washington, Jimmie Daniels, Josephine Baker, and others;
        religious themes; and race-related themes, expressed in such works as "The awakening of
        Africa," "The wounded slave," and "Mother with lynched son," with its direct reference to
        Michelangelo's Pietà. He also lived in Jamaica and completed a number of Jamaican government
        commissions for statues of national heroes, coinage, and medallions. The Barthé papers were
        acquired by the John Hope Franklin Research Center for African and African American History
        and Culture.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>The series includes research materials assembled by art historian Marcia M. Mathews on
            early English photographer Roger Fenton. The earliest date reflects a transcript of a
            letter from 1833 from Roger to his mother while he was at school. </p>
          <p>Mathews does not appear to have published any work based on this research, and there
            are no drafts in the collection, although she seems to have been involved at some level
            in Helmut Gernsheim's book on Fenton, published in London in 1954. The dozens of letters
            to Mathews from Fenton family members (1940s-1957) mention this connection and may shed
            more light on it. </p>
          <p>Other correspondence is from curators at various institutions where Fenton's
            photographs and papers were located, and from the photography lab where professional
            copies were made of his original photographs taken in the 1850s.</p>
          <p>Included in the series are six 2 1/2 x 4" cartes-de-visite photographs of Roger Fenton
            and his family (wife and daughters), early 1860s. Other photographs are copies (circa
            1940s) and include images of the Fenton home, Crimble Hall (Rochdale Borough,
            Lancashire, England), and of other family members. There appears to be an original
            unmounted albumen print of a full standing portrait, probably by Fenton, of his
            father-in-law (last name Maynard), as well as several copies of photographs by Roger
            Fenton (1850s). One modern copy photograph is of a sketch of Crimble Hall by Marcia
            Mathews.</p>
          <p>Other items include a copy of a questionnaire about the Fenton family, created by
            Mathews in the 1940s and sent to various Fenton relatives; it is accompanied by one
            respondent's handwritten answers. </p>

            <p>This large scrapbook contains articles and newspapers from one year, 1939, that deal
              almost exclusively with the war in Spain, Fascism, and the war in Europe and the
              Pacific. There are multiple features on Fascism in the United States, including
              journalistic accounts of violence against Jews and others, and articles attempting to
              educate the public about Fascism in the U.S., with examples of American Fascist
              propaganda. There is no associated name evident in the volume, but it may have been
              assembled by Marcia Mathews.</p>

          <p>The series chiefly consists of a 137-page draft biography on African American sculptor
            Richmond Barthé, in typescript form, completed by art historian Marcia M. Mathews
            sometime around 1975, accompanied by 134 photographs of Barthé's sculptures, as well as
            a few family portraits. </p>
          <p>The highly-researched biography covers the life and career of Barthé, from his birth in
            Mississippi in 1901 to his age at the time the draft was completed, 75 years, thus the
            estimated date of 1975 for the draft's completion. Appended are footnotes and a
            bibliography. The work offers many insights on Barthé's career and struggles as an
            African American artist; it also offers details about the community of friends who
            supported him, which included many gay artists and theater people. Although the work was
            unpublished as a monograph, Mathews wrote an article about Barthé in the <title
              render="italic">South Atlantic Quarterly</title> (#74, 1975) entitled <title
              render="doublequote">Richmond Barthé, sculptor.</title>.</p>
          <p>The rest of the series comprises 134 professional glossy photographs of Barthé's
            sculptures and a few paintings, almost all 8x10 inch gelatin silver prints. They
            typically include a title for the work penciled in on the verso in an unknown hand; less
            commonly, they include a date, probably of the work's completion, and occasionally, a
            photographer's name; in twelve photos the name is that of Eric Pollitzer of Hempstead,
            N.Y. </p>
          <p>There are also color snapshots of Barthé in Florence, 1971, of what appears to be an
            early solo exhibit (1930s?), as well as early portraits of Barthé (1915, 1935), his
            mother, and stepfather.</p>
          <p>Subjects for the sculptures are almost always Black figure studies such as males and
            female nudes, dancers, athletes, family groups, and busts; others are of commissioned
            sculptures of Black authors, inventors, celebrities, and other figures. There are also
            race-related themes and religious sculptures (Barthé was a practicing Catholic).</p>

            <p>The two large black-and-white 8x10 inch prints appear to be from a fairly early show,
              perhaps 1930s, while the color snapshots seem to indicate a private home setting,
              perhaps Barthé's apartment in Florence.</p>
