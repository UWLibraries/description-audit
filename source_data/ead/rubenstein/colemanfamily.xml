         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>The two daughters whose materials are predominant in this collection, Isabel and Mary
            Augusta, were born to Rufus Adams Coleman and Clara Elma Fleury Coleman. It appears from
            a business card that Mr. Coleman was an attorney and conveyancer in Toronto. He
            disappeared from their lives and does not seem to be referred to much in the collection,
            not even in his wife's obituary. Mrs. Coleman's parents, the Fleurys, were from Aurora,
            Ontario. Mrs. Coleman and her daughters Isabel, Mary, and Helen lived for a time in
            Toronto, then Germany. Isabel and Mary studied music extensively in Leipzig; Mrs.
            Coleman was an accomplished pianist and her daughter Mary a violinist. The family then
            moved to Berlin, then to Switzerland, after which they moved to England during World War
            I. They also seem to have lived in France and Italy. Mrs. Coleman and Mary Augusta lived
            in Europe for over 25 years. Isabel returned to the U.S. to work as a governess and was
            living in Asheville when her mother and sisters moved there in 1923. Mary and Isabel
            both taught in Asheville and were very active in upper-class social circles to which
            they belonged. The other sister Helen appears to have remained in Canada and may have
            been in the Weston Sanatorium, from a reference in a letter written by Isabel.</p>

            Garden Club, 1967-1969," a few items of correspondence and genealogy, and a number of
            clippings and printed materials. Topics covered by the materials include music clubs,
            instruction and performance (violin and piano) in Europe and the U.S., women's society
            life and fashions in Asheville, N.C., and women's travel in European countries during
            the 20th century. There are few comments about current events, even during the World
            Wars and the Depression, but there are extensive accounts of social life and customs in
            Europe and Asheville, N.C.</p>
