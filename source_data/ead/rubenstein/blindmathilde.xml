            feminist active in late 19th century England. This letter was written by Blind thanking
            a correspondent for sending her a newspaper clipping containing a review of her work.
            She expresses gratitude for his thoughtfulness and for his "sympathetic spirit" towards
            her work.</abstract>

         <p>Mathilde Blind was a German-born English writer and radical feminist thinker active
            during the late 19th century. She was influenced by her Bavarian parents who were labor
            activists granted political asylum in London. Stylistically, Blind's influences include
            George Eliot, George Sand, and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Although chiefly known as a
            poet, Blind also wrote biographies of George Eliot, Lord Byron, and Madame Roland, as
            well as reviews, translations, and the novel <title>"Tarantella."</title> She traveled
            extensively in Europe, which was reflected in her work. Recent scholarship (including
            James Diedrick's 2017 critical biography) has reexamined Blind in the context of her
            status as a pioneering feminist thinker.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection comprises a single autograph manuscript letter on a single folded sheet
            of paper with text on three sides dated June 19, but lacking a year. The manuscript
            address given at the top of the first page reads: Holly Cottage, The Mount, Hampstead,
            London, N.W. In the letter, Mathilde Blind writes to thank an unknown male correspondent
            for sending her a clipping from the Liverpool Mercury containing a review of one of her
            works. Blind writes, "Sitting here this evening, somewhat tired, somewhat despondent,
            there comes to me your letter. I cannot tell you how it cheered and strengthened me.
            There is something profoundly stirring in the thought that far away, among the great
            unknown multitude of one's fellow beings, there are people who have entered into one's
            work with a kindly sympathetic spirit." </p>
