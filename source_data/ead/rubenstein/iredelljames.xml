         <p>James Iredell Sr. was a statesman and one of the first justices of the Supreme Court of
            the United States serving from 1790-1799. He was born in England in 1751 and immigrated
            to the American colonies in 1767. He worked in the custom services at the port of
            Edenton, N.C. During the American Revolution Iredell Sr. helped organize the court
            system and was elected to be a judge of a superior court in 1778. He was also attorney
            general for North Carolina from 1779 to 1781, and an advocate for the ratification of
            the U.S. constitution in North Carolina before becoming a justice of the Supreme Court. </p>
         <p>James Iredell Jr. was the governor of North Carolina (1827-1828) as well as a U.S.
            Senator to North Carolina (1828-1831). He was born in Chowan County, N.C. Early in his
            career he commanded a company of volunteers in the War of 1812, practiced law in Chowan
            County, served in the North Carolina House of Commons as a representative to Edenton and
            was appointed a superior court judge. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>

            and North Carolina and national politics (1780s and 1790s); and include early letters

            include his student activities at Yale, national and North Carolina politics, naval
            appointments, patronage matters, the nullification crisis, and family affairs.

               <p>The letter series includes correspondence addressed to and from both James Iredell
                  Jr. and Sr. and is organized chronologically. The correspondence varies widely and
                  includes both family and professional letters from colleagues and fellow
                  revolutionaries concerning matters of the new nation, N.C. state government, and
                  the Supreme Court. </p>
               <p>Letters from Henry E. McCulloh, a royal official and landowner in N.C. on 18
                  February 1789, 11 September 1767, and 3 March 1768 and from William R. Davie,
                  governor of N.C. and co-founder of the University of North Carolina, on 7
                  September 1789, 16 November 1789, and November 22, 1789 (as well as numerous
                  others by both McCulloh and Davie) are addressed to Iredell Sr. A 10 March 1790
                  letter from John Jay, written shortly before he completed his work as Secretary of
                  State, congratulates Iredell and advises him on judicial matters. Facsimiles of
                  the orders by which George Washington appointed Iredell Sr. to the Supreme Court
                  on 10 February 1790 are included. A long text of March 1777 addressed to King
                  George III of England invokes America’s rights to liberty, outlines Britain’s
                  abusive treatment of its colonies, and is signed by “A British American,” likely
                  Iredell Sr. himself. </p>
               <p>The correspondence addressed to James Iredell Jr. includes appeals from aspiring
                  judge appointees and district attorneys nominees. In an 1840 letter (one of
                  several exchanged between Tyler and Iredell), the future tenth president of the
                  United States, John Tyler, laments that he is unable to attend Iredell Jr.’s
                  celebration in Raleigh due to assaults from the newspaper press during the
                  presidential election. The bulk of the correspondence in the four folders with
                  undated correspondence is addressed to a “Dear Cousin” and primarily discusses
                  family matters. </p>
               <p>There are also typed copies of letters. These materials include twentieth-century
                  reproductions of letters included in the Rubenstein Library’s collections, as well
                  as letters from other archives. These two bodies of materials are housed in
                  separate folders. The folder containing copies of letters not in Duke’s collection
                  also contains typed lists of people and places referenced in the letters. </p>
