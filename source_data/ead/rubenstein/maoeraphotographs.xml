            black-and-white photographs, varying in size from about 4x6 to 9.5x11, some with
            card-stock backing. The images mainly portray women at work, as textile and other
            industry workers; as scientists, medical professionals, and academics; and as
            participants in Communist Party education. There are also images that pertain to
            improvements in women's status, whether for minorities or workers in general. The
            majority of the photographs bear captions in both Chinese and English. Several have
            Hsinhua News Agency markings; beyond such markings, the photographer is unidentified. A
            few have sizing information for reproduction, and many were likely used in an exhibition
            on the status of women in modern China. Loosely organized according to amount within the

            professional women, Communist Party workers, commune and other workers, and
