      <head>Biographical / Historical Note</head>
      <p>During World War II, the Political Warfare Executive (PWE) was a British clandestine body
        created to produce and disseminate both pro-Allied and anti-Axis propaganda, with the aim of
        damaging enemy morale and sustaining the morale of the occupied countries.</p>
      <p>The Psychological Warfare Division was a joint effort between the United States and Great
        Britain, and conducted similar operations during and following D-Day, 1944.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The collection includes pro-Allied, pro-Axis, and anti-Allie and anti-Axis propaganda in
        the form of flyers, broadsides, and leaflets that were distributed or dropped in the United
        States, England, Germany, occupied France, and the Pacific arena from 1939 and 1945. The
        majority of the leaflets are in German and were dropped by the Political Warfare Executive
        (PWE) over Germany. There is also a significant run of anti-Semitic, anti-Bolshevik,
        pro-German broadsides published by Theodor Kasse and the Deutscher Fichte-Bund of Hamburg,
        Germany, in English and intended for Allied audiences. The collection also contains
        propaganda leaflets from the Psychological Warfare Branch, U.S. Army Forces, Pacific Area,
        APO 500, most of which are in Japanese (most with English translations), some of them in Tok
        Pisin. There are also leaflets from the French exile government dropped over occupied France
        (in French, most accompanied by English translations); some propaganda newsletters,
        magazines and newspapers from France and the Netherlands (in English translation); German
        propaganda in English intended for dropping over Great Britain; some examples of Japanese
        propaganda (in Japanese); and a few single leaflets in Finnish, Russian, and Burmese. One
        notable portion of the collection is a set of broadsides illustrated by Pvt. Franklyn,
        printed by Special Service I.B.S., targeting American soldiers and warning them against
        loose women who may be infected with venereal disease. These posters often include the
        campaign's catchphrase, "Leave 'Em Alone! Don't be a Dope with a Dose."</p>
