         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p> Youth Noise Network (YNN) is a youth radio project based at the Center for Documentary
            Studies. YNN brings together a diverse group of Durham teenagers to produce a weekly
            radio show that addresses current issues of particular concern to teens. YNN
            participants learn various aspects of the documentary arts and produce their own audio
            documentaries. </p>
         <p> In 2003 a group of teenagers who had participated in the Youth Document Durham summer
            program at CDS decided that they were interested in continuing to do documentary work
            throughout the year. They worked with CDS staff members to create Youth Noise Network,
            which remains a youth-led and youth-driven project. Originally started to explore race,
            racism, and culture in Durham, YNN has since become a way for teens to creatively
            express their ideas and document a variety of topics, including education, family,
            immigration, civic engagement, young artists, and politics. </p>
