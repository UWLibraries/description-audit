      <abstract id="aspace_eaca12de581c17f8ae9bf46f40bead37">Virginia Woolf was an English writer
        and publisher, and one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century. Collection
        contains a letter from Virginia Woolf to Quentin Bell. Topics include her cook's operation;
        distractions during the letter writing process, "How any woman with a family ever put pen to
        paper I cannot fathom;" how Vanessa Bell produced an old French lady to replace the cook;
        and relates the incident of lost keys to the [Gordon Square] flat. She informs Quentin that
        "We are now at Rodmell for Whitsun, and the Austrians are gliding over our heads like gulls.
        Yes, this is a fact. They have tents on the downs and prove that one can fly up and down
        Asheham Hill without an engine. As I never doubted it myself, I take little stock of it."
        This is in reference to very enthusiastic and popular Sussex gliding, or sail plane, club.
        After a bit of village business, she adds that the family cocker spaniel has had five pups
        and that "Julian [Bell, Quentin’s older brother] is coming to Charleston with a troupe next
        week." She also reports that the senior tutor of Kings College has been shot by one of his
        students. Woolf fills Quentin in on the further doings of the Keyneses, Roger Fry and his
        Aunt Vanessa with regard to a troublesome art show, from which Fry has resigned, and looks
        forward to each friend bringing her up to speed on the outcome. She tells Quentin that Vita
        Sackville-West's book is selling so well "that Leonard and I are hauling in money like
        pilchards from a net. We sell about 800 every day. The Edwardians it is called." Woolf asks
        her nephew if he is at his family's French retreat in Cassis, and asks for a letter from him
        describing his "life from the inside." In closing, she laments she hasn't actually said what
        she wanted to say, and that the "snap-snap of the typewriter frightens me as the snap of a
        turtle frightens fish. So good bye." Also contains a black-and-white photograph of Virginia
        Woolf and Quentin Bell, undated, but probably around 1930.</abstract>
