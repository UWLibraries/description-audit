            (1892-1970), 10th Duke of Grafton, was a soldier and farmer. The collection consists of
            a single daily diary that records the events of two trips taken by Charles Alfred Euston
            FitzRoy and his third wife, Rita, in 1949. Slightly less than half of the diary is used,
            171 pages in all, with entries from February 7 through May 28, and from August 8 through
            October 7. The first portion of the diary describes FitzRoy's daily activities while
            staying on his ranch near Enkeldoorn in Southern Rhodesia (now Chivhu, Zimbabwe) in
            March and April and while in Kenya visiting acquaintances in February and on safari in
            May. The second used portion of the diary records the daily activities of FitzRoy, his
            family, and friends while hunting in northern Scotland.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection consists of a single daily diary that records the events of two trips
            taken by Charles Alfred Euston FitzRoy, 10th Duke of Grafton, and his third wife, Rita,
            in 1949. Slightly less than half of the diary is used, 171 pages in all, with entries
            from February 7 through May 28, and from August 8 through October 7.</p>
         <p>The first portion of the diary describes FitzRoy's daily activities while staying on his
            ranch near Enkeldoorn in Southern Rhodesia (now Chivhu, Zimbabwe) in March and April and
            while in Kenya visiting acquaintances in February and on safari in May. Comments on
            ranch operations are often brief references to visiting "the dip" where livestock is
            submerged in chemicals to kill parasites, but include references to a cattle drive to
            Salisbury (now Harare, Zimbabwe). Outside of ranching, much of FitzRoy's time was spent
            sketching, visiting acquaintances, and sightseeing in nature reserves and towns
            including Victoria Falls in Southern Rhodesia, Livingstone and Mazabuka in Northern
            Rhodesia (now Zambia), and Fort Victoria (now Masvingo, Zimbabwe). Daily commentary
            during the 12-day hunting safari in Kenya is more extensive, providing details about
            stalking and killing several types of antelope, a gazelle, an impala, a zebra, and an
            African buffalo.</p>
         <p>The second used portion of the diary records the daily activities of FitzRoy, his
            family, and friends, including the Duke of Gloucester on a few occasions, while hunting
            in northern Scotland. Comments chiefly recount the location of various members of the
            party and the number and type of animals killed, typically grouse, stags, and
            rabbits.</p>
