      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The collection pertains to the life and political activism of Sam Reed of Durham, North
        Carolina, particularly in connection with the civil rights movement and race and labor
        relations in the South. The records of the organization founded by Reed, Trumpet of
        Conscience, include a nearly complete run of the newsletter of the same name, 1987-2000;
        meeting notes, agendas, and speeches; mission and goal statements; ideas for community
        events and fund-raising; and financial items, chiefly printing bills for the newsletter. A
        folder also contains fliers, programs, invitations, and notes on Trumpet of Conscience
        events, which were held in the Hayti Center, Duke Chapel, and N.C. Mutual Life Insurance
        offices, among other locations. </p>
      <p>Other papers include correspondence to Reed, chiefly relating to the Trumpet of
        Conscience's work; obituaries, tributes, interviews, speeches, and news articles, by and
        about Sam Reed; photographs of Reed and his wife, other activists, supporters, and local
        politicians, and gatherings; and awards honoring Reed and the organization he founded. An
        oral history of Sam Reed's life is present in the form of transcripts from four interviews
        conducted in 1996-1997. </p>
      <p>Topics covered or touched on by these materials include Sam Reed's life as a memeber of a
        Jewish family who emigrated from the Ukraine; the U.S. Depression and political activism in
        the U.S.; the history of race relations in Durham, North Carolina; civil rights actions in
        North Carolina and Durham; Durham politics and politicians; the involvement of Duke
        University and North Carolina Central students, faculty, and administration in various local
        events; political action by Durham citizens groups; labor issues and unions; and, more
        generally, human rights issues in the South.</p>
      <p>A selection of materials from the collection have been digitized and are available in Duke
        Digital Collections. Original audiovisual materials are closed to use; for access, please
        consult with a reference archivist before coming to use the collection. Acquired as part of
