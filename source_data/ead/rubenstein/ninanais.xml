        the American book collector, Thomas DiGenti, who is trying to find a copy of her literary
        magazine Two Cities. Nin does not have one, but directs him to the NYC bookshop The Phoenix,
        on Cornelia St. She has turned over distribution of Two Cities to The Phoenix at a financial
        loss due to constraints on her time. Nin writes of her desire to publish the work of new
        writers. She goes on to describe a recent trip to Europe where she visited London, Brussels,
        and Paris, where she was well-received because of the popularity of her work there. Nin asks
        the collector, Thomas C. Di Genti, if he has an extra copy of her book D,H. Lawrence: An
        unprofessional study. She wants to send it to her London publisher, who is interested in
        putting out a new edition. Nin states that she's currently busy writing Seduction of the
        Minotaur, the last part of her Cities of the Interior sequence which she describes as a
        "finale to the novels."</abstract>
