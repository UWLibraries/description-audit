            commercially-produced stereograph cards dating from 1898-1905, depicting scenes from the
            Philippine Islands during the Philippine-American War, with a few taken in the U.S. of
            the embarkation and return of troops. Almost all are in black-and-white, with a few in
            color. The large majority convey the preparations, armed conflicts, and aftermath of the
            war, with scenes of battlegrounds including Angeles, Luzon, Malabon, Pasay,
            Pasig,Taquig, Tarlac, and San Pedro Macati. Other war-related images feature military
            personnel, officers, troop movements, encampments, hospitals, ruins, dead soldiers,
            allied native troops, prisons and prisoners. In addition, there are two groups, <emph
               render="bold">Places</emph> and <emph render="bold">People</emph>, which feature
            views of ordinary citizens and their dwellings, and places such as markets, bridges,
            railway stations, rivers, and buildings in Dagupan, Manila, Malabon, Pasay, Pasig, and
            San Pedro Macati. Almost all the stereographs bear captions, dates, and the names of the
            publishers, chiefly Underwood &amp; Underwood (New York), C.H. Graves (Philadelphia),
            Keystone View Company (Pa.), and George W. Griffith (Griffith &amp; Griffith,
            Philadelphia). Some have the names of individuals, possibly the

         <p>The Philippine-American War was fought from February 1899 to April 1902 between the
            Philippine and the U.S. armies, following the annexation of the Philippine Islands at
            the end of the Spanish-American War. It officially ended in July 1902. The conflict is

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Collection comprises 176 commercially-produced card stereographs dating from 1898-1905,
            depicting scenes from the Philippine Islands during the Philippine-American War. Almost
            all are in black-and-white, with a few in color. The large majority convey the
            preparations, armed conflicts, and aftermath of the war, with scenes of battlegrounds
            including Angeles, Luzon, Malabon, Pasay, Pasig,Taquig, Tarlac, and San Pedro Macati.
            There is at least one card from Camp Meade, and a note on one card depicting a battle in
            the Philippines indicates the collector felt it may have been posed in a U.S. military
            camp setting. One card was published with a few paragraphs of war narrative on the back.
            The cards measure 3.5x7 inches.</p>
         <p>There are also many other war-related images of personnel, officers, troop movements,
            encampments, ruins, dead soldiers, prisoners, and insurgents. Along with these are
            stereographs with views of ordinary citizens and their dwellings, as well as places such
            as street markets, houses, bridges, railway stations, and buildings in Dagupan, Manila,
            Malabon, Pasay, Pasig, and San Pedro Macati.</p>
         <p>Among the 144 images in the <emph render="bold">War-Related Series</emph>, Embarkment
            subdivision, are thirteen scenes taken in 1898 of regiments and troops boarding ships in
            the U.S. A few are marked as being taken in San Francisco. Some feature dramatic scenes
            with such titles as "Soldiers and their sweethearts on the eve of departure," and
            "Troops for Manila - last man climbing aboard." There are also scenes of U.S. soldiers
            returning home in 1902. Other groups into which the series has been arranged include
            battles (40 views), encampments (13), military drills (14), insurgents (23), military
            and civilian hospitals (9), prisons and prisoners (6), and other war-related scenes (14)
            such as the building of military railroad supply lines, and native buffalo hauling water
            to the front.</p>
         <p>In addition, there are two smaller groups, <emph render="bold">Places</emph> and <emph
               render="bold">People</emph>. The <emph render="bold">Places Series</emph> features 22
            cards depicting locations such as headquarters for military leaders; city and town
            streets; citizens' houses - some thatched; notable buildings, including the "Insurgent
            House of Congress" in flames; railway stations; St. Ignatius Church, Manila; battlements
            and the U.S. flag; and ruins. there are views of Manila, the Pasig River, and a train
            derailment on a bridge in Luzon. There are often groups of people, including civilians
            and military men, in these images. The last two cards in the Places series are in color.
            There are ten views In the <emph render="bold">People Series</emph>, chiefly group shots
            of military personnel and Filipinos, but with a few images of individuals, one of whom
            is Major General Henry W. Lawton. One card is captioned "Filipino police - once
            insurgents, now faithful servants of Uncle Sam." The last two cards in this series are
            in color.</p>
         <p>Almost all the stereograph cards bear captions and the names of commercial publishers;
            names appearing most often include Underwood &amp; Underwood (New York), C.H. Graves
            (Philadelphia), Keystone Views (Pa.), and George W. Griffith (Griffith &amp; Griffith,
            Philadelphia). Most are dated with the year. Some carry the names of individuals,
            possibly the photographers.</p>
