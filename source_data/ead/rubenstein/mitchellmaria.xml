      <p>Maria Mitchell was a pioneering American astronomer. A Nantucket native, Mitchell worked
        from 1836-1856 as the first librarian at the Nantucket Atheneum, during which time she
        discovered "Miss Mitchell's Comet." In 1865, she was appointed the first professor of
        astronomy at Vassar College, where she worked until her retirement. Michell also identified
        with the abolition and women's rights movements. She was the first woman elected to both the
        American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Philosophical Society.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection comprises three manuscript notes by Mitchell. The first, written while Mitchell
        was the librarian at the Nantucket Atheneum, is addressed to a Mrs. Greene regarding a John
        Quincy Adams letter Mitchell has forwarded to her "at Phebe's request" for her autograph
        business. The second, written while Mitchell was teaching at Vassar College, is addressed to
        a Mrs. Burner asking for letters of recommendation to a number of people in London. The
        third, dated 1877, to a Miss Ladd, sends her regrets for not being able to speak at the
        Harvard School commencement.</p>
