      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Julius Logan Brasher Papers document the personal and pastoral life of the Methodist
        minister. Son of Holiness Movement minister John Lakin Brasher, Julius Logan Brasher
        attended Drew Theological School. He served as a Methodist minister in New Jersey from 1937
        to 1976, after which time he retired to his original home of Gadsden, Alabama. He continued
        to serve as a pastor and religious advisor in that community through 2011. Brasher's
        activities as a minister at six churches in New Jersey and two in Alabama are documented
        throughout the collection. Collection contains Brasher's diaries and record books, sermon
        notes, church files, name and subject files, correspondence, photographs, some printed
        materials, and one audiotape. </p>
      <p>Diaries files comprise diaries, calendars, and pastor's record books kept by Brasher
        between 1946 and 1977. Entries contain notes about parishioners, appointments, and sermons
        given.</p>
      <p>The sermons and religious writings files contain full-length sermons as well as notes and
        cue cards used by Brasher to give sermons at churches throughout his career, including his
        years as a student at Drew Theological School. Topics range from weekly Sunday services to
        weddings, memorials, and holidays. Some sermon notes are folded into the church program
        during which the sermon was given. Many sermons are undated. Other writings include some of
        Brasher's academic papers from Seminary as well as narrative religious writings from
        throughout his career. A portion of the sermons arrived alphabetically sorted by Brasher,
        referring to the titles of the sermons.</p>
      <p>The Churches files relate to Brasher's activities as a pastor at United Methodist churches
        in New Jersey and Alabama. The files contain church programs, newsletters, correspondence,
        and printed materials collected and created by Brasher. Files from Gadsden UMC include memos
        and notes from the Julius Brasher Discussion Class. The following churches are represented
        in the series: • First Congregational Church of Chester, NJ (Chester, NJ): 1939-1942 •
        Blairstown United Methodist Church (Blairstown, NJ): 1942-1946 • Denville Community Church
        (United Methodist) (Denville, NJ): 1946-1955 • Rutherford United Methodist Church
        (Rutherford, NJ): 1955-1962 • Westwood United Methodist Church (Westwood, NJ): 1962-1968 •
        Plainfield United Methodist Church (Plainfield, NJ): 1972-1976 • Walnut Grove United
        Methodist Church (Walnut Grove, AL): 1978-1979 • Gadsden United Methodist Church (Gadsden,
        AL): 1979-2011</p>
      <p>Correspondence files contain letters received by Brasher beginning with his tenure at Drew
        Seminary and throughout his career. Primary among the correspondents is his father, John
        Lakin Brasher. The elder Brasher wrote letters to Julius and the rest of the family several
        times a week from the 1930s through the 1950s. Other correspondents include parishioners,
        friends, and other family members. Name and Subject Files contain correspondence, printed
        materials, notes, and writings on subjects assigned by Brasher. Among the name files is a
        folder with Brasher's correspondence with Bishop G. Bromley Oxnam, a social reformer and
        Methodist Bishop. Oxnam was accused of being a communist by Donald Jackson. Some
        correspondence relates to these accusations, and Brasher's support of Oxnam. Subject files
        include Brasher's files from Drew Theological School, the Rotary Club, the Northern New
        Jersey Cabinet, and his work on the Board of Education trustees and the Board of
        Discipleship Trustees.</p>
      <p>Photographs are mostly undated black-and-white snapshots from Brasher's church communities
        in New Jersey. Common subjects are Sunday school classes, church picnics, headshots of
        congregants, and promotional images of the churches where Brasher was pastor.</p>
