         <abstract id="aspace_84088fb35f39be7ce211bbd22805f18d">Col. David S. Wilson (1825-1881),
            originally from Ohio, was a lawyer and editor in Dubuque, Iowa. He served with the Sixth
            Cavalry of Iowa from 1862-1864 and also practiced law in San Francisco and Washington,
            D.C., during the 1860s and 1870s. He was appointed circuit judge and district judge in
            Dubuque and served until 1878. He and his wife, Henrietta, had four children: Henry,
            Gertrude, John, and David. The family's papers consists largely of personal
            correspondence between D.S. and Henrietta, as well as a significant amount of
            correspondence between the couple and their children. Also included in the collection
            are a selection of D.S. Wilson's legal and political materials, such as a diary from his
            1860 term in the Iowa General Assembly, miscellaneous court case briefings, and some
            materials from his work as an attorney for the New Idria Quicksilver Mining
            Company.</abstract>

         <head>Historical note</head>
         <p>David S. Wilson was born in Steubenville, Ohio on March 18, 1825. He relocated to
            Dubuque, Iowa, in 1839, and began operating a newspaper, the Miners' Express, in 1841.
            He remained the newspaper's editor until 1845 when he sold his interest and resumed his
            study of law. Elected to the Iowa House in 1846, Wilson took an active role in
            re-submitting Iowa's constitution to the people. During the Mexican War he shared
            responsibility for moving the entire tribe of Winnebago from their reservation at Fort
            Atkinson into Minnesota. </p>
         <p>Returning to Dubuque, Wilson was elected county attorney for two terms. Wilson served as
            mayor from 1856 to June 1, 1857. In 1857 Wilson was elected to a term of four years in
            the Iowa Senate. In 1861 he was nominated by his fellow legislators to deliver a lecture
            on "The Right of States to Secede from the Union." The lecture, considered the first of
            its kind, showed such depth of research that it was adopted as the war document of the
            state. The legislature printed and distributed thousands of copies. </p>
         <p>With the outbreak of the Civil War, Wilson became a "War Democrat," a supporter of the
            Union. When the loyalty of an Irish regiment being raised in Dubuque was questioned,
            Wilson left for Washington, D.C. to meet with Secretary of War Stanton, an old friend.
            Wilson received Stanton's permission for the Irish regiment to join the Union army.
            Wilson was also asked to return to Iowa as a colonel to raise a cavalry regiment.
            Turning away from his profitable legal career, Wilson accepted the commission and raised
            the Sixth Iowa Cavalry Regiment. This served in Dakota protecting settlers against the
            Sioux. Wilson resigned his commission and returned to Dubuque in 1864.</p>
         <p>Later that year, Wilson left for California where he joined his brother, Samuel W.
            Wilson, in a legal practice for two years in San Francisco. Moving to Washington, D.C.,
            he practiced before the federal courts for several years. Upon his return to Dubuque,
            Wilson was appointed in June 1872 Circuit Judge to fill an unexpired term. In July he
            was appointed District Judge to fill another vacancy. In 1874, he was elected to the
            position and served until January 1, 1879. </p>
         <p>David married Henrietta E. Sanford in 1850 and the couple had four children: Henry,
            Gertrude, John, and David. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The Col. David S. Wilson Family Papers document the activities of Col. David S. Wilson
            and his family of Dubuque, Iowa, from the mid-1850s through the early 1870s. The
            majority of the collection consists of the familyâ€™s correspondence. David and his wife,
            Henrietta, wrote frequent letters during his many absences from Dubuque; both parties
            are well-represented in the family's papers. Topics tended to center on the family's
            finances, personal and family news, and local events. Col. D.S. Wilson's military
            service during the 1860s was only mentioned in passing, as it related to the family's
            travels or finances. Later letters from D.S. Wilson's time in San Francisco discuss
            court cases and business news, and include details on family disputes between David and
            his brother Samuel M. Wilson, also a lawyer. D.S. Wilson repeatedly wrote about his
            unhappiness at being separated from his family in San Francisco. He finally returned to
            Dubuque to practice law there and in Washington, D.C. </p>
         <p>Other major sources of correspondence are the couple's four children, particularly Henry
            (called "Harry") and Gertrude (called "Gertie") Wilson, who spent time at Kenyon College
            in Ohio and Brooke Hall in Pennsylvania. Henry and Gertrude regularly wrote home to
            their parents and included news about their activities and classmates. Nearly all of the
            collection's letters from 1873 and 1874 are directed to Gertie, who was actively courted
            by several men. Gertrude's suitors between 1870 and 1874 include James S. Donnell
            (Pittsburgh), John H. Rutherford (Cincinatti), Alonzo E. Wood (Dubuque), James H. Park,
            Charles Plunkett, and George Brock (Chicago); she eventually married Brock on March 2,
            1874. The Wilsons' third child, John, appears to have attended school in Dubuque;
            letters between him and his classmates are also present in the collection and include
            many secret messages, codes, and nicknames. "Johnnie" was regularly referred to as the
            Champion Flirt of Iowa. Only a few letters remain for the youngest son, David Jr.,
            nicknamed "Dada."</p>
         <p>The collection includes interesting political and legal documents. A diary kept by
            Wilson in 1860 records his activities as a state representative in the Iowa General
            Assembly. Also present are miscellaneous materials from some of D.S. Wilson's court
            cases, including several from the U.S. District Court of Southern California relating to
            the case McGarrahan vs. the New Idria Quicksilver Mining Company. Wilson's materials
            also contain a cipher that appears to relate to that case, including code names for
            various parties and terms. There is also a 1855 General Land Office certificate for D.S.
            Wilson, signed by President Franklin Pierce.</p>
