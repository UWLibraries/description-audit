            silver prints of images taken during the 1930s and 1940s by photographer Gjon Milin.
            Through new tecniques of strobe lighting and electronic flash which Mili developed at
            MIT, the black-and-white images, some of which were used by <title render="italic"
               >Life</title> magazine, portray human locomotion and the movements of other physical
            phenomena such as cascading water, frozen in time. Human subjects include two African
            American children playing with paddleballs, a man in the shower, a man aiming a racket
            at a shuttlecock, and female nudes. One image is of the photographer Mili photographing
            a stream of water with his camera. Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts
            at Duke University.</abstract>

         <p>Photographer Gjon Mili was born in 1904 in what is now known as Albania, and emigrated
            to the United States in 1923, where he studied engineering at MIT. Working with Harold
            Edgerton at MIT, Mili developed new photographic technologies of strobe lighting and the
            electronic flash, and began using them to freeze and capture motion in a single frame of
            photographic film. In 1939 he was hired as a freelance photographer by <title
               render="italic">Life</title> magazine, and became famous for his motion-in-time
            sequences of 20th century dancers, jazz musicians, and athletes. Among his most
            well-known images are those of artist Pablo Picasso using light to "draw" linear shapes
            in the air. Gjon Mili died in Connecticut in 1984.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Collection comprises 20 gelatin silver prints taken during the 1930s and 1940s by
            photographer Gjon Mili. Using new techniques of strobe lighting and electronic flash
            that he developed at MIT, Mili created stop-action and multi-image frames portraying the
            movement of the human body (reminiscent of the more scientific locomotion studies of
            Ã‰tienne Jules Marey and Eadward Muybridge) and of objects such as an egg breaking in a
            pan, a jet from a siphon bottle, and a cascade of water. Human subjects in the
            collection include two African American children playing with paddleballs, a man in the
            shower, a man aiming a racket at a shuttlecock, and female nudes. One image is of Mili
            photographing a stream of water with his camera.</p>
         <p>The prints range in size from 8x10 to 11x14 inches. Most are vintage prints, created
            from the 1930s to the 1940s; only one bears a date - 1943. A few are mounted on thin
            board, but the majority are unmounted paper prints. All are stamped with the
            photographer's name and "From the Richard Checani Collection." One print bears the stamp
            "Life Photo, to use" referring to Mili's work for the magazine. A few bear penciled
            captions such as "cartwheel" and "nude descending a staircase," and one penciled
            notation explains the genesis of the image: "Full frame (35 mm) shot by Wallace
            Kirkland, who was at my side, G [jon]." Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary
            Arts at Duke University.</p>
