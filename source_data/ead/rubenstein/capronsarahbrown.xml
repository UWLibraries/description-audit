      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection comprises a copy of a letter (10 pages) written by Sarah B. Capron in Mana
        Madura, India, to unidentified recipients on 1865 December 26 and 28. Sarah was in southern
        India, with her two daughters, practicing medicine and treating residents of the town,
        although her medical training was minimal. She stated that "more knowledge of medical
        services would save me a vast amount of care.... when I go to America, I must have some
        Hospital experience &amp; practice, somehow" (page 1). She then narrated a typical day for
        her, telling of the various patients she treated, including a man with stomach pain, a woman
        with knee pain, a young boy who was gored by a cow, a man with ear discharge, a woman with
        eye pain, children with dysentery, a beggar with sores, and an infant with lung
        congestion.</p>
