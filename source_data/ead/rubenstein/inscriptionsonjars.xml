      <p>Count Robert du Mesnil du Buisson (9 April 1895, Champobert, Bourges – 8 April 1986, Caen)
        was a French historian, soldier, and archeologist. He was noted for his early use of
        geophysical survey for archaeology. He was son of Auguste, comte du Mesnil du Buisson and
        Berthe Roussel de Courcy, and married Jeanne Leclerc de Pulligny on 26 June 1923. </p>
      <p>He was director of excavations at Qatna (el-Mishrifeh: 1924, 1927–29), Til-Barsip (Tell
        el-Ahmar: 1927, 1929–31), Hadatu (Arslan Tash, 1928), and was vice-director of excavations
        at Dura-Europos from 1932 to 1937 coordinated between Yale University led by Clark Hopkins
        and the French Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres. He discovered the Synagogue of
        Dura Europos and published on the synagogue's frescos in 1939. Among his other archeological
        finds were the Baalshamin and the Arslan Tash amulets.</p>
