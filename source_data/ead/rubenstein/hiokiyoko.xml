        a resident of Ōmiya-shi, Saitama, Japan, near Tokyō. Collection comprises a photograph
        album maintained by Yōko Hioki primarily featuring her family and school. She was a 9th
        grader in 1953. There are 128 albumen and gelatin silver photographs ranging in size from
        0.875 x 1.375-inches to 7.75 x 5.5-inches. The majority of the photographs are captioned.
        The first photograph in the album is a group family photograph taken sometime during the
        war, before the deployment of one of her family members. In addition, besides several
        pictures of Yōko, there are group and individual photographs of her school teachers and
        classmates, including reunion photographs, and many images of class field trips, including
        one trip to Nikko. There are also casual and formal individual and group images of Yōko's
        family, including those taken at a birthday party for her sister.</abstract>
