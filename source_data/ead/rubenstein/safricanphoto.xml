            black-and-white and color exhibit prints representing the work of over 50 South African
            photographers who documented conditions during and after apartheid, from about the 1940s
            to 2013, with most dating after 1960. Arranged in five series representing projects
            curated by documentary photographers Alex Harris, Paul Weinberg, and others: Beyond the
            Barricades, The Cordoned Heart, Then and Now, Underexposed, and The Other Camera. There
            is also a series of work by Jeeva Rajgopaul. Set in rural and urban South Africa, the
            images portray political rallies; protests; forced removals; funerals; social gatherings
            such as dances and concerts; work and domestic life; the life of the elderly, the
            migrants, and the impoverished; and labor organizing and strikes. There are many
            portraits of individuals of all races and classes, well-known activists and politicians,
            as well as countless ordinary South African citizens. Many of the photographers were
            members of Afrapix, a collective photography agency engaged in documenting the
            anti-apartheid struggle. There is a small amount of printed material, as well as a
            selection of digital image files and a digital audio file of an exhibit talk. Acquired

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Collection consists of over 1100 black-and-white and color exhibit prints representing
            the work of over 50 South African photographers who documented conditions during and
            after apartheid from about the 1940s to 2007, with most dating after 1960. Many of the
            photographers were members of Afrapix, a collective photography agency engaged in
            documenting the anti-apartheid struggle. </p>
         <p>The prints are arranged in five series representing projects curated by documentary
            photographers Alex Harris and Paul Weinberg, and others: <emph render="bold">Beyond the
               Barricades, The Cordoned Heart, Then and Now</emph>, <emph render="bold"
               >Underexposed</emph>, and <emph render="bold">The Other Camera</emph>. There is also
            a separate but related series of work by photographer Jeeva Rajgopaul. Each project
            resulted in an exhibit and four of them produced books (one is only available in online
            form). The series and the work of each photographer are described in full in this
            collection guide.</p>
         <p>Set in rural and urban South Africa, the images document events such as rallies,
            protests, forced removals, funerals, social gatherings and leisure pursuits, violence
            between Africans, and labor strikes and meetings. There are also many portraits of
            individuals and families: migrant workers, farm laborers, HIV positive individuals,
            affluent South Africans, domestic workers, protesters, and well-known activists and
            politicians of all races and parties. </p>
         <p>The images take the form of black-and-white and color prints, chiefly gelatin silver and
            pigmented inkjet prints, with most measuring approximately 11x14 to 16x20 inches. There
            is a small amount of printed material documenting the Cordoned Heart exhibit, as well as
            selected digital image files, and a digital audio file of exhibit opening remarks. </p>
         <p>Among the photographers in this collection are several whose individual bodies of work
            are also held at Duke: David Goldblatt, Cedric Nunn, and Paul Weinberg. Details
            regarding all the photographers are found in a biographical section in this collection
            guide.</p>

               <p>Consists of 79 gelatin silver prints of images taken from 1981 to 1988 by South
                  African phographers, many of whom were members of Afrapix, the collective photo
                  agency that documented resistance to apartheid in the 1980s. The images originated
                  with the Afrapix documentary project "Beyond the Barricades." The project resulted
                  in an exhibit and a book, <title type="simple" render="italic">Beyond the
                     Barricades: Popular Resistance in South Africa</title> (1989), published in
                  cooperation with the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University. Afrapix
                  photographers Omar Badsha, Gideon Mendel, and Paul Weinberg selected photographs
                  for the book.</p>
               <p>The photographs are unmatted, exhibit prints measuring approximately 11.75x16
                  inches. They document social and political protest in South Africa during the
                  violent and bloody period of the 1980s; subjects include funerals, conflicts with
                  police, death squads and vigilantes, rallies and demonstrations, and other
                  political gatherings. Well-known individuals appearing in the photographs include
                  Chief Buthelezi, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, President P.W. Botha, Mrs. Botha, Mrs.
                  Tshabalala (wife of the mayor of Soweto), and activists such as Billy Nair and
                  Dorothy Nyembe. Numerous anti-apartheid organizations are portrayed, including the
                  African National Congress (ANC), the Congress of South African Trade Unions
                  (COSATU), the Leandra Youth Congress, the Natal Indian Congress, the Black Sash
                  Society, and the United Democratic Front (UDF).</p>
               <p>The images were taken by twenty South African photographers, whose work is listed
                  in this order: Omar Badsha, Julian Cobbing, Paul Grendon, Steve Hilton-Berber,
                  Dave Hartman, Rashid Lombard, Roger Meintjies, Gideon Mendel, Eric Miller, Santu
                  Mofokeng, Themba Nkosi, Cedric Nunn, Billy Paddock, Myron Peters, Chris Qwazi,
                  Jeeva Rajgopaul, Guy Tillim, Zubeida Vallie, Gille de Vlieg, and Paul Weinberg.
                  Most are represented by one or several prints, but Badsha, Mendel, and Weinberg
                  contributed over a dozen images each. There are also a few prints whose
                  photographers have not been identified. </p>
               <p>The bulk of the photographs are described fully with captions and dates in the
                  book <title render="italic">Beyond the Barricades</title>. Some of the photographs
                  are also available as digital images mounted on the library server; please contact
                  Research Services for access.</p>

               <p>These black-and-white images came out of a documentary project by the photographic
                  collective Afrapix, as part of the Second Carnegie Inquiry into Poverty and
                  Development in South Africa. They document a crucial period of protest and social
                  upheaval in South African history, and focus on poverty and the daily lives of
                  people living under apartheid. Photographs depict neighborhoods, rural and urban
                  residences, social life, families, work conditions, events in South African
                  history such as forced relocations, and scenes of political or labor conflict. </p>
               <p>Twenty photographers are represented, with their work arranged in this order: Paul
                  Alberts, Joseph Alphers, Omar Badsha, Michael Barry, Bee Berman, Michael Davies,
                  David Goldblatt, Paul Konings, Lesley Lawson, Chris Ledechowski, Rashid Lombard,
                  Ben Maclennan, Jimi Matthews, Gideon Mendel, Cedric Nunn, Myron Peters, Berney
                  Perez, Jeeva Rajgopaul, Wendy Schwegmann, and Paul Weinberg. The matted and
                  unmatted gelatin silver prints range in size from approximately 12x16 to 16x20
                  inches, with duplicates of images found across size groups.</p>
               <p>Textual materials include exhibit brochures and an exhibit installation guide.
                  There is also a limited edition portfolio with ten signed photographs selected
                  from the exhibit; prints have been housed with their respective photographers.
                  Many of the photographs are also available as digital images mounted on the
                  library server; please contact Research Services for access. </p>
               <p>The prints in this series were part of the Cordoned Heart exhibit, curated by
                  Cornell Capa, Alex Harris, and Margaret Sartor, which appeared originally at the
                  International Center of Photography in 1986 and toured for a number of years
                  afterwards. An accompanying book, <title render="italic">South Africa: The
                     Cordoned Heart</title> (1986), was edited in part by Afrapix member Omar
                  Badsha. There are some images used in the book which are not present in this
                  collection. In addition, there are several unidentified prints which do not appear
                  in the book. </p>

                  <p>Images document the daily life of unemployed men, pensioners, and people living
                     in compounds and shantytowns in rural areas. Other scenes include trade union
                     meetings and strikes. Settings include a funeral, street scenes, meetings of
                     residents and their attorneys, religous events, removal protests and a march.
                     Some images were shot in urban and rural Lesotho, others in the rural Transkei,
                     Kwazulu, and the Inanda shantytown. </p>
                  <p>Persons of note in the photos of opposition movements are Albertina Sisulu, Dr.
                     Essop Jassat, Nokukhanya Luthuli, and Paul David (Natal Indian Congress). Other
                     images by Badsha can be found in the <emph render="bold">Beyond the

                  <p>Photographs come from two series that document single-sex men's compounds
                     (created along with photographer Paul Alberts, whose images are in a separate

                     camp to another, and daily life for the gold miners in the single-sex

                  Gisèle Wulfsohn. The 160 color and black-and-white prints were shown together in a
                  2008 exhibit at Duke University, curated by South African photographer Paul
                  Weinberg, and later published in book form.</p>
               <p>The photographers were asked to contribute twenty of their most significant
                  images: ten taken during South African apartheid, and ten taken in the years
                  following democratic elections in 1994. The apartheid-era images portray the
                  segregated and impoverished lives, street violence, protests, and funerals that
                  marked these decades; and the rapidly changing social life, new relationships,
                  continued political struggle, the AIDS crisis, and the after-effects of civil war
                  that characterized the post-apartheid period.</p>
               <p>The photographs in the two series "Then" and "Now" are a mix of black-and-white
                  gelatin silver prints and color inkjet or chromotype prints, with many of the
                  black-and-white prints coming from the earlier period and color from later
                  decades. They all measure approximately 12x17 inches, and are housed in 16x20 inch
                  hinged mats. Each photographer's 20-print set is divided into the two subgroups
                  "Then" and "Now." </p>
               <p>All of the images are available online as a Duke Libraries digital exhibit. The
                  series also contains a digitized audio file of speakers and musicians recorded at
                  the exhibition's opening, also available through the online exhibit. The speakers
                  and musicians are: Kay-Robert Volkwijn, Karin Shapiro, Karen Jean Hunt, and Roger
                  Lucey.</p>

                  <p>Wulfsohn's images from the apartheid era are mostly in color, and focus on
                     affluent South Africans and their relationship with other communities; images
                     show a polling station during democratic elections of 1994, domestics at work,
                     and fashion designers at a photo shoot. Her post-apartheid images in this
                     series feature black-and-white portraits of women activists Maniben Sita and
                     Ellen Khuzwayo, and HIV positive men, women and children at home and in
                     clinics. Other images by Wulfsohn can be found in the <emph render="bold"

               <p>These images by relatively unknown and "underexposed" South African photographers
                  were collected as part of a project sponsored by the Centre for Curating the
                  Archive at the University of Cape Town and photographer/curator Paul Weinberg. The
                  photographs feature a variety of subjects, including South African political
                  protests, family life, leisure pursuits, rural life, poverty, and work life. Some
                  of the images were taken during the 1940s and 1950s - a significant glimpse into
                  South African society and culture at the time. </p>
               <p>The "Underexposed" series houses over 600 color and black-and-white prints. There
                  are approximately 50 digital prints from each photographer, as well as a smaller
                  number of vintage gelatin silver prints. Digital prints are 11.5x16.5 inch
                  pigmented inkjet prints on Epson Archival Matte Paper. </p>
               <p>Eleven photographers are represented: Rodney Barnett, Arthur Bolton, Basil
                  Breakey, Anne Fischer, Jenny Gordon, David Hemson, Daniel Morolong, Cedric Nunn,
                  Graeme Williams, Janje Wissema, and Gisèle Wulfsohn. The work of some of these
                  photographers is also found in other series in this collection. Prints are grouped
                  by photographer. The 151 prints that comprise the output of one photographer,
                  Graeme Williams, are arranged in six topical subseries, and appear first. All
                  other photographers are listed in alphabetical order.</p>

                     migrants, and squatters; there are also a few of political party activists.

                     war in that country. The series includes six vintage prints from the 1980s in

               <p>These 25 black-and-white and color photographic prints form part of "The Other
                  Camera" project and exhibit, curated by Paul Weinberg, and offer a view of the
                  many different styles and approaches of 20th century South African street
                  photography. The images were taken by male and female photographers from the 1970s
                  through the 2010s, and were produced in inkjet format by Weinberg, then archived,
                  digitized, and exhibited with support from the University of Cape Town and Duke
                  University. These images are a selection of prints from the exhibit; all of the
                  images are available through the online e-book, The Other Camera (2014).</p>
               <p>The known artists represented in this collection are: Lucky Sipho Khoza (3
                  prints); William Matlala (5); Lindeka Qampi (10); and one print by Paul Weinberg.
                  There are also six prints from the work of an unknown photographer from
                  Maribastad, Gauteng Province (near Pretoria), from the collection of photographer
                  and film-maker Angus Gibson. </p>
               <p>All of the images are portraits of black South Africans, men and women. Themes
                  include street culture, township life, the individual gaze, human identity and
                  status, South African families, and social conditions in South Africa. </p>
               <p>The images are all inkjet prints measuring 13x19 inches, and were exhibited at
                  Duke University in 2014.</p>

                  <p>Taken by an unknown photographer sometime around 1970, these images are
                     black-and-white studio portraits of men and women. They include a man in
                     uniform, a man with a degree and graduation robes, a single woman, two
                     musicians with a guitar and trumpet, and a man with two small children, one of
                     whom appears to be albinistic. </p>
                  <p>The prints have all been given the same title of "Unknown photographer, studio
                     portrait, Marabastad, Gauteng." Marabastad is a historic district near
                     Pretoria; Gauteng is its province. </p>
                  <p>These are among the few surviving prints from this studio; they were created
                     from negatives by Angus Gibson, who later returned to the location to find that
                     the studio was gone and the negatives had been destroyed.</p>

               <p>These prints by photographer Jeeva Rajgopaul were received along with the South
                  Africa Documentary Photography collection. The 10 black-and-white portraits of
                  South African men and women are untitled and undated, but were likely taken during
                  the 1980s and 1990s. They measure approximately 11x14 inches. The individuals are
                  unidentified but are likely to be chiefly activists, writers, and artists.</p>
