               <p>Anderson's captions and introductory text are included with the photographs, and
                  are also reproduced here:</p>
               <p>For more than a century, the sweet scent of tobacco drifted through the streets of
                  downtown Durham, North Carolina--the one-time world capital of cigarette
                  production. To many, it was the smell of money. The ornate brick factories that
                  sprung up along the main rail line served as impressive castles of industry to
                  multiple generations of North Carolinians who enjoyed the benefits of the booming
                  market.</p>
               <p>By the late 1990s, the tobacco industry had gone bust in Durham and the Liggett
                  &amp; Myers Tobacco Company, which occupied a sprawling complex of factories west
                  of downtown, moved its operations up the road to Mebane. In December 2005, D.L.
                  Anderson began photographing inside the vacant warehouses where thousands had once
                  worked. The Liggett &amp; Myers factory complex had been purchased by Blue Devil
                  Partners, a local development firm, with plans to renovate it into mixed-use
                  residential and commercial property-ensuring the future existence of the historic
                  buildings. The following photographs provide a parting glimpse of a once mighty
                  empire as it underwent a massive transformation to a new era of growth for the
                  Bull City.</p>

                  <p>A large photograph of the New Cigarette Factory is reflected in a mirror
                     hanging in the wood-paneled board room on the first floor of the factory. In
                     the 1940s, Liggett &amp; Myers created an annual promotional publication titled
                        <title type="simple" render="italic">Tobaccoland</title>. One entry reads,
                     "Regularly employed by Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company for handling leaf
                     tobacco and in the manufacture of Chesterfields, are more than thirteen
                     thousand men and women, whose length of service averages better than ten years.
                     Each day a Chesterfield messenger goes to Durham's new Federal Building with a
                     certified check for approximately a quarter of a million dollars. This check is
                     to purchase the revenue stamps needed for a single day's output at the Durham
                     facilities." The wood paneling in the board room was removed and reinstalled in
                     Alivia's Durham Bistro.</p>

                  <p>A heavy fog envelops the Durham skyline as an excavator demolishes F House,
                     where the pipe shop and other craft services were once located in the middle of
                     the Old Cigarette Factory complex. The removal of F House allowed for the
                     creation of a semi-enclosed courtyard, complete with a swimming pool and green
                     spaces. The original V-shaped structure of Old Cigarette Factory, also known as
                     Duke Factory, was once four stories tall before being <emph
                        render="doublequote">decapitated</emph> in 1948 for a variety of reasons
                     that make little sense today. The southern portion, the right-hand corner, of
                     Duke Factory was built in 1884 by tobacco baron Washington Duke--his first of
                     many ornate brick tobacco factories in Durham.</p>

                  <p>After tobacco was conditioned and stored in bulkers on the second floor of
                     O'Brien, it was loaded onto a system of conveyer belts, carried over Main
                     Street and lifted to the sixth floor of the New Cigarette Factory for casing
                     and cutting. Although Bull Durham Tobacco Company was the first major tobacco
                     company in Durham, with around 900 employees in 1884, it was James B. Duke's
                     focus on innovative methods of cigarette production that quickly propelled
                     Washington Duke &amp; Sons (later the American Tobacco Company) to become the
                     world wide leader in cigarette manufacturing at the turn of the 20th
                     century.</p>

                     O'Brien Warehouse stored three types of tobacco; Turkish or Oriental,

                     different quantities to produce distinctive brands of cigarettes. During the

                  <p>The $150 million dollar historical restoration and renovation of the Liggett
                     &amp; Myers factory complex by Blue Devil Partners is considered to be one of
                     the most ambitious in North Carolina history. Approximately 992,000 square feet
                     of former factory space will be converted into mixed-use residential and
                     commercial property when the third and final phase is completed in 2010. The
                     L&amp;M factory complex is listed on National Registry of historical places and
                     Blue Devil Partners has worked closely with the State Historic Preservation
                     Office and the National Park Service to ensure the expansion project will meet

                  <p>The Turkish Unit was a large vacuum chamber designed to moisten and heat
                     tobacco, specifically the small-leaved Turkish variety, by forcing steam
                     through the leaves and opening their pores to prepare it for production.
                     Turkish tobacco, or Oriental tobacco, was grown in Turkey and the Near East,
                     then shipped to Durham where U.S. Customs agents inspected each batch. This
                     vacuum unit was built by Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Works in 1939.</p>

                  <p>Around 3000 female employees of Liggett &amp; Myers, nearly all
                     African-American, would strip the stems from tobacco leaves by hand inside Cobb
                     Warehouse. It was a seasonal task, starting in September and continuing into
                     the next year. They would wear blue dress uniforms, and when the whistle blew,
                     would file out and walk two by two up the sidewalk to the Five Points
                     neighborhood. "The sidewalk just about turned blue," said former employee
                     Charlie Bock. In the second half of the 20th century, the task was automated
                     and stems would be saved to be incorporated into the final smoking tobacco
                     blend.</p>

                  <p>Once the climate controls inside Cobb Warehouse were turned off, the paint
                     quickly began to peel from the walls inside the four-story structure. James B.
                     Duke's mighty American Tobacco Company finished building the Cobb Warehouse in
                     1899, the same year they acquired the smaller, St. Louis based, Liggett &amp;
                     Myers Tobacco Company. Twenty-two years later the U.S. Supreme Court found the
                     American Tobacco Company guilty of being business monopoly, a violation of the
                     Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. As a result of that ruling, American Tobacco
                     Company was divided into four companies: the American Tobacco Company, R.J.
                     Reynolds, P. Lorillard, and Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco.</p>
