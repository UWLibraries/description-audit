      <abstract id="aspace_ad9a2c4bebddf698ee06ac4498e8d544">Collection consists of a 44-page
        scrapbook belonging to an unidentified compiler, that documents the history of Fort Des
        Moines as a Women's Army Corps training center, and more specifically the 404th Women's Army
        Corps (WAC) band, the first African American female band in the United States military. In
        addition to the approximately 100 photographs, there are photographic postcards, and
        clippings from official Fort Des Moines publications. The scrapbook begins with a photograph
        of the front page of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin from 8 December 1941, followed by a short
        history of Fort Des Moines, with clippings and photo postcards documenting its conversion to
        the first Women's Army Auxiliary Corps training center. The second half of the scrapbook
        documents the African American women's band, with photographs showing the women in and out
        of uniform; many of the photographs are signed or are otherwise identified in ink. Scenes
        include the practice room, women marching with instruments, and band members enjoying
        off-duty pastimes. There are at least two photographs of Major Charity Adams Earley, the
        first commissioned African American WAC. Acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin Research
        Center for African and African American History and Culture.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection consists of a forty-four page scrapbook belonging to an unidentified compiler,
        documenting the history of Fort Des Moines, Iowa, as a Women's Army Corps (WAC) training
        center, and the 404th Women's Army Corps band, the first African American female band in the
        United States military. The scrapbook contains 100 photographs, all but one black-and-white,
        ranging in size from 2 x 3 inches to 7 1/2 x 8 3/4 inches. The creator also included
        photographic postcards as well as clippings from official Fort Des Moines publications. The
        covers for the scrapbook are missing. </p>
      <p>The first page contains a photograph of the front page of the <title render="italic"
          >Honolulu Star-Bulletin</title> from December 8, 1941. The following early pages provide a
        short history of Fort Des Moines, with clippings documenting its conversion to the first
        Women's Army Auxiliary Corps training center. The clippings are augmented by photo postcards
        depicting the grounds, along with one showing a woman blowing a bugle into a oversize
        megaphone.</p>
      <p>Documentation of the African American women's band begins on page 21, with a group
        portrait. Other photographs show the women in uniform; many of the photographs are signed or
        are otherwise identified in ink. Images include the practice room, women marching with
        instruments, and off-duty band members relaxing, riding bicycles, traveling together,
        preparing for sleep, or playing with pets. There are at least two photographs of Major
        Charity Adams Earley, the first commissioned African American WAC. </p>
      <p>Acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin Research Center for African and African American
        History and Culture.</p>
