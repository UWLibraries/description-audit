        advocating for the adoption of the practice of cremation. Some materials are addressed to
        members of his family, including son Herbert Thompson. Letters are numbered and itemized
        inventory is included with the materials.</abstract>

      <p>The initial Rubenstein collection consisted of two letters transferred through the Trent
        Manuscripts History of Medicine collection. (Their origins and acquisition history are
        unknown.) In 2019, the bulk of the collection was acquired through Accession 2019-0171, a
        transfer to Rubenstein Library by the Wisconsin Historical Society.</p>

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Originally from Suffolk, Henry Thompson was a white British surgeon and professor at the
        Royal College of Surgeons, specializing in the bladder and urinary tract. Thompson's
        surgical expertise and reputation led him to be appointed as surgeon-extraordinary to King
        Leopold I and II of Belgium; he also operated on Napoleon III shortly before his death.
        Thompson helped found the Cremation Society of England (now Great Britain) in 1874, and
        served as its first president. The society sought to legitimize the practice of cremation in
        Great Britain.</p>
      <p>Thompson's other interests included painting, astronomy, and collecting Chinese porcelain.
        He was knighted in 1867 and became a baron in 1899. </p>
      <p>Thompson married Kate Loder in 1851, and the couple had three children. </p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection of letters to and from Sir Henry Thompson (1820-1904), a white English surgeon
        who was a founder of the Cremation Society of England. Most letters in this collection are
        largely polite and perfunctory notes between Thompson and peers; some correspondents include
        his wife, the pianist Kate Loder; King George of England; and King Leopold II. The
        collection documents Thompson's social status and activities between the 1850s and early
        1900s. It contains few details about his medical practice or personal life, but indicates
        many high-profile and celebrity acquaintances and contains some autographs (for example,
        Henry James). Letters are numbered and an itemized inventory is included with the materials.
        There is also a detailed correspondents' list, transcriptions of some of the more
        information-heavy letters, and an appraisal of the letters, conducted for the Wisconsin
        Medical Society Foundation in 2003.</p>
      <p>The original Trent Manuscripts Collection is foldered separately within the collection, and
        consists of the following items: ANS, a dinner invitation, and ALS, advocating the adoption
        of the practice of cremation. Items are accompanied by a bibliographic note describing
        Thompson's dinner parties.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>Folders of materials arranged loosely chronologically, with some undated materials in
            later folders. Includes an 1851 letter to Kate Loder, called "Kit", which contains a
            doodled self-portrait by Thompson and describes his current illness. An undated letter
            from Henry James in the House of Commons seeks to secure a vote from MP W. H. Leatham,
            then suffering from gout and under Thompson's care. There are letters to Thompson from
            King George V (a thank you note, 1893), Empress Frederick of Germany (1891), and King
            Leopold II (1869, 1872, 1875, 1876, 1880). Some letters are directed to Henry's son Sir
            Herbert Thompson, including a condolence note from King George in 1904, following Henry
            Thompson's death. One letter from Thompson advocates the adoption of cremation.</p>
          <p>The majority of the letters are perfunctory and polite, without many details beyond
            dinner invitations and customary exchanges of courtesies between Thompson's
            acquaintances in the British aristocracy and elite society. Some materials are not
            correspondence - there are empty envelopes and some scrap notes.</p>
