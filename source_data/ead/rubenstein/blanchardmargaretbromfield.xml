        and 1878. Henry B. Rogers served as her executor. There are also her manuscript records
        outlining the distribution of the estate, dated 1867-1868. The Bromfield School is mentioned
        extensively in the will and the distribution documents. In the will she outlines "if boys

        that of girls." In addition, there are a few records related to the estate of Margaret
        Blanchard's grandfather?, Henry Bromfield, in Cheltenham, England, dated 1836-1842,
        including the executor's account. Unrelated documents include a written agreement between
        Mary Blanchard and Hiram Osborn for his assumption of the farming duties in 1864, along with
        a letter regarding the establishment of trustees for the Bromfield school, dated around
        1890.</abstract>

        lists of stocks and bonds; related correspondence; and payments made against the estate of
        Margaret Bromfield Blanchard in 1877 and 1878. Henry B. Rogers served as her executor. There
        are also her manuscript records outlining the distribution of the estate, dated 1867-1868.
        The Bromfield School is mentioned extensively in the will and the distribution documents. In
        the will she outlines "if boys are admitted [to the school], I order that their number shall
        always be one-third less than that of girls." In addition, there are a few records related
        to the estate of Margaret Blanchard's grandfather?, Henry Bromfield, in Cheltenham, England,
        dated 1836-1842, including the executor's account. Unrelated documents include a written
