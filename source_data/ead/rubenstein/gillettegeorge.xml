         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>George W. Gillette was born at Marines, in Onslow Co., N.C., in 1888, the only son of
            William Issac Gillette and Rena Winbury Gillette. He attended North Carolina State
            College and later the Army Engineer School. His military career began in 1916 and lasted
            until his retirement in 1948. As an officer in the Army Corps of Engineers, Gillette
            helped organize the Engineer Training Center at Fort Belvoir, Va., commanded the
            Engineer Training center at Fort Lewis, Washington, and served as Division Engineer both
            of the New England and South Atlantic Divisions. He was District Engineer in Wilmington
            in 1945. Subsequently, he brought his engineering expertise and knowledge of waterways
            construction (as well as his personal connections) to the consulting field. He was
            associated (through connections) to the consulting field. He was associated (through the
            World Bank, United Nations, and private agencies) with projects in Latin America,
            Africa, and South East Asia.</p>
         <p>In 1939, Colonel George W. Gillette of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers surveyed and
            mapped the area from Fort Monroe, Virginia to Fort Sumter, South Carolina, which
            included the Onslow County coastline and the New River. The map is believed to have
            fostered the interest of the War and Navy Departments in establishing an amphibious
            training base in the area.</p>
