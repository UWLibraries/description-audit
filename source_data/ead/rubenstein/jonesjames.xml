         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>James Burt Jones Jr. was a paymaster in the U.S. Navy from approximately 1914 through
            the end of World War I. Jones was originally from Batavia N.Y. and attended University
            of Michigan for a period. During his time in the Navy, Jones rose to the rank of
            Lieutenant and was stationed in various cities in the eastern part of the U.S.,
            including New York City, Washington D.C., Akron N.Y., and Erie P.A. The exact dates of
            his overseas deployments are unclear from the correspondence.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The James Burt Jones Jr. Papers contain correspondence addressed to Jones, who is
            referred to alternatively as James, Jim, Burt, and occasionally Dave. The letters date
            from 1906-1919, with the majority of the letters dated to 1918. The folders are arranged
            chronologically by month and year.</p>
         <p>Jones, who was originally from Batavia N.Y., was a paymaster in the U.S. Navy during
            World War I and the letters are addressed to him while he was stationed at various
            locations including New York City, Washington D.C., Akron N.Y., and Erie P.A. Several
            letters date from his time in Ann Arbor, where he was a student at the University of
            Michigan. Some of the correspondence is from Jones's family and male friends, but it is
            primarily written by female correspondents located in Rochester N.Y., Ann Arbor,
            Detroit, Brooklyn, Chicago, Erie, and Buffalo N.Y. Many of these letters are from a
            woman named Florence, who alternatively signs as "Happy" or "Bee," a kindergarten
            teacher with whom Jones was romantically involved. Other letters are written by a woman
            named Esther, who was Jones's classmate at University of Michigan, and who provides
            numerous insights into the lives of female university students.</p>
         <p>These letters express the correspondents' sorrow at Jones's departure, wishes for his
            safe return, questions and fears about the war, and inquiries as to his exact
            whereabouts and intentions. They also provide interesting insights into the politics and
            culture of the United States in the early twentieth century. Letters refer to the
            Temperance Movement (April 17, 1918), Women's Suffrage (April 17, 1918, among others),
            the Armistice (November 12, 1918), German-American families with sons fighting on both
            sides of the war (April 28, 1917), as well as to current films and other popular topics.
            One letter, from Jones Jr.'s father to his mother, dates from 1898. The collection also
            contains several photographs of the correspondents and various printed invitations to
            parties and dances.</p>
         <p>The collection includes one folder of postcards, letters, birth announcements, and other
            small cards addressed to various other individuals apparently unrelated to Jones, many
            of whom are located in Batavia N.Y. This correspondence dates from approximately 1893 to
            1922. Several of these letters are written by children in Los Angeles to their
            grandmother in N.Y.</p>
