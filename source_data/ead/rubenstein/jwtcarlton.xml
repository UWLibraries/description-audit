         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The diaries of William James Carlton span the years 1862 to 1877; the biography dates to
            about 1964. There are transcripts of the diaries and a draft manuscript of a biography,
               <title type="simple" render="italic">A Portrait of William James Carlton,
               1838-1902,</title> by Frankie McKee Robins. The transcripts are slightly annotated.
            For the years from 1862 to November 1864 the diaries chronicle William James Carlton's
            participation in the United States Civil War. From 1864 to 1877, the diaries primarily
            describe family events and church-related activities. A December 1873 entry indicates
            that no diaries were kept for the years 1865 to 1872. The bulk of the biography
            describes the years from 1861 to 1862.</p>
         <p>The diaries begin during approximately the fifth month of William Carlton's enlistment
            in the 48th Regiment, New York Volunteer Infantry. His entries describe drills,
            recreation and holiday celebrations, sermons addressed to the troops, illness, and
            funerals. He briefly describes incidents and comradely associations among various
            regiments, including the 3rd Rhode Island [Heavy?] Artillery. Most of the descriptions
            of battles are from an observer's point of view but there are some sketchy descriptions
            of those in which he participated. Ships carrying troops, supplies, and mail are
            frequently named. During the period in which the 48th Regiment, New York Volunteer
            Infantry was in the areas of Hilton Head and Daufuskie Island, South Carolina, and Fort
            Pulaski, Georgia, William Carlton visited the local area. He describes trips to Jones,
            Bird, and Tybee islands in Georgia. While on Daufuskie Island, the Stoddard plantation
            on Calibogue Sound was occupied by his regiment.</p>
         <p>Entries from 1862 to 1864 reveal William Carlton's personal interests and activities.
            They include frequent discourse about specific books, magazines, and newspapers he read,
            with comments on authors and texts and comparisons of different titles. Correspondence
            between family and friends is regularly noted, including <emph render="doublequote">sub
               rosas</emph> to a brother. There are observations about African Americans, some of
            whom were escaped slaves, others were servants or in another sort of service to the
            Union, and a Black regiment, which Mr. Carlton refers to as the South Carolina
            Volunteers.</p>
         <p>The diaries for 1873 to 1877 primarily discuss family activities and illness, the
            children's social development, and birthdays and holiday celebrations in Elizabeth,
            N.J., and nearby areas of New York. The Carltons were members of St. Paul's, probably a
            Methodist Episcopal church, in Elizabeth. Church-related activities were central in
            family life and included attendance at Sunday School and services. The diaries have
            notes about various preachers and the titles of sermons they gave. William Carlton was a
            trustee of the church. He was also on the board of the YMCA (probably the Young Men's
            Christian Association) and served as its Treasurer in 1873. His advertising business is
            mentioned only cursorily in the Diaries. In the entry for December 5, 1864, he wrote,
               <emph render="doublequote">Commenced to canvas for advertisements this morning for
               several papers.</emph> Most other business-related entries merely note that he went
            to the office. In 1873 Mr. Carlton was the chair of the Committee on Credentials for the
            Advertising Agents Convention held at the Astor House. In 1877 he discussed the purchase
            of the Lady's Book with Mr. [Louis Antoine] Godey. There are a few mentions of Mr.
            Carlton's employee, <emph render="doublequote">Thompson</emph> [James Walter Thompson],
            including social occasions he shared with Mr. Carlton. James Walter Thompson bought the
            William J. Carlton agency from Mr. Carlton in 1878 and renamed it the J. Walter Thompson
            Company.</p>
         <p>The biography briefly describes William James Carlton's early years, including his
            family and education. The bulk of the Biography describes William Carlton's military
            service and the 48th Regiment, New York Volunteer Infantry. The biography Appendix
            includes information from secondary sources, such as biographical sketches of members of
            the 48th Regiment, New York Volunteer Infantry and other military officers; excerpts
            from reports and published sources about the 48th Regiment, New York Volunteer Infantry;
            and other aspects of the Civil War. The biography Outline includes scattered, brief
            references to the William J. Carlton's advertising business but is predominantly
            descriptive of family life.</p>
