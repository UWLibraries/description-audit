      <abstract id="aspace_93743c090c4df7003a659135a487a845">Missionary to India and author of
        religious works. Cousin to Virginia Woolf; daughter of James Fitzjames Stephen, who was
        brother to Leslie Stephen, Virginia Woolf's father. Handwritten diary, 151 full pages, by
        16-year-old Dorothea Jane Stephen. Entries document the author's anticipation of Jubilee Day
        (July 21, 1887, the 50th anniversary of Queen Victoria's reign), as well as her activities
        on the day itself (written in red rather than black ink), and the parties and church
        services following it. Other topics include her daily life in London and two family trips in
        England. In particular, Stephen chronicled (through both words and ink drawings) her family,
        including her mother and two sisters; school classes and examinations; visiting rounds;
        current fashion, horses, and carriages rides; leisure activities and sports, especially
        collecting bugs, reading, dancing, and playing lawn tennis; and visiting the coast at
        Barnstaple, England. She also described sites in London, including Buckingham Palace, St.
        Jame's Park, Piccadilly, and Kensington Heights.</abstract>
