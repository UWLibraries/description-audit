      <abstract id="aspace_272648fd6c0037ce9317c90eb8b9f3e4">John Willis created these six composite
        color images to articulate and consider the connections between photographic portraits taken
        by the Khmer Rouge of young people in Tuol Sleng prison in Phnom Penh, where an estimated
        14,000-20,000 victims were executed from about 1975-1979, and images of deteriorating mural
        frescoes at the Emperor's Palace, also in Phnom Penh. The portraits are said to be of prison
        workers, and were exhibited in 2008 at the prison, now a genocide museum. Five of the
        historical photographs are portraits; the sixth shows a group of what appears to be Khmer
        Rouge soldiers in uniform. The photographer's images show that the original photographs on
        exhibit were defaced with graffiti and other marks by visitors to the museum. The neglected
        Emperor's Palace frescoes, whose images flank the victim's portraits in Willis' work, depict
        scenes from the Cambodian epic poem, the Reamker, which speaks to human issues of love,
        revenge, loyalty, and trust. The color inkjet prints were created from 2009 to 2011.

      <p>American photographer John Willis created these six composite color images to articulate
        and consider the connections between photographic portraits taken by the Khmer Rouge of
        young people in Tuol Sleng prison in Phnom Penh, where an estimated 14,000-20,000 victims
        were executed from about 1975-1979, and images of deteriorating mural frescoes at the
        Emperor's Palace, also in Phnom Penh. </p>
      <p>The portraits are said to be of prison workers, and were exhibited in 2008 at the prison,
        now a genocide museum. Five of the historical photographs are portraits; the sixth shows a
        group of what appears to be Khmer Rouge soldiers in uniform. The photographer's images show
        that the original photographs on exhibit at the genocide museum were defaced with graffiti
        and other marks by visitors. </p>
      <p>Images of the neglected Emperor's Palace frescoes flank the victim's portraits, creating
        dramatic diptychs and triptychs, and depict scenes from the Cambodian epic poem, the
        Reamker, which speaks to human issues of love, revenge, loyalty, and trust. </p>
      <p>The six color inkjet prints measure approximately 7x15 inches and were created from 2009 to
        2011. </p>
