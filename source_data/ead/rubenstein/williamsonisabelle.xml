      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Isabelle Howard Williamson (1895-1930) was a resident of Charlottesville, Virginia who was
        married to Lee Hoomes Williamson (1891-1942), a civil engineer. Her mother was Isabelle
        (Holmes) Perkinson (1856-1924), wife of William Howard Perkinson, professor of German and
        Italian at the University of Virginia; widowed when her husband died young, she earned a
        living by running a well-known boardinghouse, Eden Holme, in Charlottesville. Many former
        students wrote to her following their years at the University.</p>
      <p>Isabelle, her daughter, married Lee Hoomes Williamson while they were living in Chile in
        1917. They had three children. Their final residence was in Lexington, Virginia.</p>

      <p>This collection was originally acquired as part of the George Frederick Holmes family
        papers, beginning in 1935. Sometime around 1941 the papers of Isabelle (Perkinson)
        Williamson and Isabelle (Holmes) Perkinson were processed and described by library staff,
        and became a separate collection.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection comprises papers of Isabelle (Perkinson) Williamson, wife of Lee Hoomes
        Williamson, engineer, and of her mother, Isabelle (Holmes) Perkinson. Included are many
        letters to Isabelle (Holmes) Perkinson from former students of the University of Virginia
        who had patronized her boardinghouse in Charlottesville, Virginia, letters from Isabelle
        (Holmes) Perkinson to her daughter describing life in Charlottesville, and commenting on
        Edwin A. Alderman, President of the University of Virginia, and many notes and bills
        reflecting frequent financial difficulties. Also included in this collection are letters
        between Isabelle P. and Lee Hoomes Williamson.</p>
      <p>Many of the letters describe travels: letters from Isabelle P. Williamson to her mother
        were sent while attending the Georgetown Visitation Convent, Washington, D.C., while on a
        tour of Europe during 1909 and 1910, while visiting in Virginia and in the Panama Canal
        Zone, while working in the Navy Department in Washington, 1913-1917, and, after her marriage
        in 1917, while living near Rancagua, Chile, and in Puerto Rico with her husband. Also
        included in this collection are letters between Isabelle P. Williamson and Lee Hoomes
        Williamson. </p>
      <p>The collection also contains information on the early motion picture industry; life during
        the Roaring Twenties; and the beginning of the Great Depression.</p>
      <p>Papers relating to World War I consist of letters from soldiers and war workers, food
        cards, and letters from Mary Peyton, who was with a field hospital unit in France.</p>
      <p>Sixty-nine photographs - chiefly of family members and views from a Chilean mining
        settlement - and ephemera such as postcards, calling cards, tickets, greeting cards, and Lee
        Williamson's WWI military identification card round out the collection.</p>
      <p>Much more information on the collection's contents, written up in 1941, can be found in the

            <p>Formats include one tintype, several cartes-de-visite, and many small early 20th
              century gelatin silver prints in various sizes. </p>
            <p>Most of the photographs are of family members and friends - men, women, and children;
              most are without captions and unidentified. The earliest portrait appears to be from
              the 1870s, and the latest from the 1920s. A series of photographs, some with captions,
              were taken in a copper mining area in central Chile, in the hamlets of Caletones and
              Sewell, home to American families. There are also a few scenes taken in Puerto Rico.
              Other photographs are of unknown locations.</p>
            <p>One photograph of interest is of three French children taken in a studio setting by
              photographer Joseph A. Collin in 1919; the original glass plate negative is in the
              American Red Cross image collection in the Library of Congress, digital file number
              LC-DIG-anrc-18496. There are hundreds of similar photographs of orphaned children in
              the collection. On the back of the photograph in the Isabelle Williamson collection is
              the Red Cross Bureau of Photography stamp, and the address of the woman who adopted at
              least one of the children, who were probably orphaned. The origin of this print of the
              image is unknown, but Lee H. Williamson was a 2nd Lieutenant in the 55th Engineers,
              Company A, Expeditionary Forces from 1918-1919. A Mary Peyton, figured in the family
              letters, was also serving during the war as a nurse in a field hospital.</p>

            <p>A wide variety of formats includes: Commission Day cards for Wearmouth Bridge,
              Sunderland, in England, 1827-1843; calling cards, many with sympathy notes associated
              with the funeral of Isabelle Perkinson in 1924; early 20th century Christmas cards and
              notes; religious cards; a ticket to the seventh Olympiad, Antwerp, 1920; news
              clippings, some about engineer Lee H. Williamson's involvement in a Louisiana
              intracoastal canal; tobacco coupons; a small street map of Berlin; and other items. </p>
            <p>Also of interest is a version of "Dixie" with verses composed for World War I. The
