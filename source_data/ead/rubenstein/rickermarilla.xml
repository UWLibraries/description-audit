      <p>Marilla Ricker was a New Hampshire native nationally known as a lawyer, suffragist, writer,
        freethinker and prison reformer. She was the first woman admitted to the bar in the state of
        New Hampshire and was the first woman to attempt to run for governor and congressional
        office in that state. She was also the first woman to attempt to vote and the first woman to
        seek a diplomatic post. Although none of these attempts were successful, she succeeded in
        bringing national public attention to the cause of women's suffrage and equal rights.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection comprises a scrapbook (66 leaves, 27 x 35 cm.) bound in maroon cloth with oak
        leaf and acorn decoration on front cover. The first leaf is inscribed "Marilla M. Ricker,
        March 1, 1896, 30 Codman Place, Roxbury, Mass." It consists chiefly of U.S newspaper
        clippings by and about Ricker. Some clippings have mss. annotations indicating the titles
        and dates of the newspapers. Topics include Ricker's political writings, philanthropic
        activities, and extensive activism on behalf of women's suffrage. Suffrage activities
        detailed in the newspaper stories include Ricker's legal activities, attempts to vote, run
        for public office, and apply for a diplomatic post. Also pasted in are six notes addressed
        to Ricker from correspondents including the Arts and Crafts Movement leader Elbert Hubbard,
        Illinois Senator John A. Logan, and the African-American author, orator, and abolitionist
        Frederick Douglass. Clipped autographs from faith leader Sarah J. Farmer, suffrage leader
        Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Ohio Senator John Sherman are also pasted in. Black and white
        portraits and illustrations of Ricker are interspersed throughout. The scrapbook also
        contains an 1881 certification admitting Ricker to the bar of the District of Columbia, an
        1899 brief from a case Ricker tried before the Supreme Court of New Hampshire, printed
        ephemera including the seal of the American Secular Union and Freethought Federation, and 25
        U.S. postage stamps.</p>
