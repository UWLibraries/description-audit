      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection contains seven letters (22 pages) M. J. Scarlett wrote between 1845-1864. Two
        letters were addressed to her sister, Elizabeth (1845, 1849), and five to her niece (1858,
        1860, 1863, 1864). In the letters she discussed details of her life at the time, from the
        teaching of students to the choosing of proper fabric for sewing a dress, making a
        comfortable sitting room, or studying public health and hygiene. She also mentioned many
        family matters. She commented on her hopes for the abolition of slavery and the infighting
        among abolitionists at a recent national meeting, and noted her puzzlement that those
        Quakers who would quickly speak as abolitionists would not also speak up on issues of faith
        within the Society of Friends. During the Civil War, she described the effect of the draft
        in Philadelphia, recorded the general concern that the Army of the Potomac needed to be
        successful, and pointed to camps nearby as well as to funerals passing. Collection also
        includes an undated broadside for "An Introductory Lecture to a Course on Physiology" to be
        delivered by Scarlett. Acquired as part of the History of Medicine Collections (Duke
        University), the Lisa Unger Baskin Collection, and the Sallie Bingham Center for Women's
        History and Culture.</p>
