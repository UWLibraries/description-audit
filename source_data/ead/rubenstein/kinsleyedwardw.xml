      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection of correspondence belonging to Edward Wilkinson Kinsley chiefly concerns
        his efforts in soliciting funds for societies aiding freed slaves, in lobbying for
        Congressional action to grant equal pay to African American troops in the Union Army, and
        personally assisting former slaves. The correspondence includes many pieces written by
        others to Kinsley documenting these issues.</p>
      <p>Civil War letters written to Kinsley by soldiers, many of them African Americans, aid
        society workers, and others describe the service of the 55th Massachusetts Regiment during
        its service in South Carolina and Georgia, with mention of the 54th Massachusetts, and the
        35th Regiments of U.S. Colored Troops; life in New Bern, North Carolina during its
        occupation, written by soldier Thomas Kinsley (45th Mass. Volunteers); and skirmishes with
        Confederate troops. </p>
      <p>The letters of James Monroe Trotter, African American officer and later U.S Post Office
        administrator, refer to the African American troops' attitudes toward salary and inequality.
        Trotter's letter of Nov. 21, l864, describes the celebration held by the 55th Massachusetts
        Regiment of Colored Troops when their salaries arrived at their camp on Folly Island, S.C.
        Letters from other black troops also express to Kinsley the desire for salaries as a
        recognition of equality as well as due payment for services rendered. </p>
      <p>The letters from Trotter and other black soldiers also document the history of the 55th
        Regiment during its service in South Carolina and Georgia. Among the other regiments of the
        U.S.Army mentioned are the 54th Massachusetts and the 35th and 38th Regiments of U.S.
        Colored Troops. These last two units are referred to at times by their original names, the
        1st and 2nd Regiments of North Carolina Volunteers (Colored).</p>
      <p>Reconstruction letters comment on efforts to educate and provide for the freed slaves;
        citizen reaction to having an African American (James M. Trotter), in charge of enforcing
        peace and emancipation in Orangeburg, South Carolina; and Massachusetts politics in the
        1870s.</p>
      <p>Kinsley took a particular interest in Mrs. Mary Ann Starkey and her children, of New Bern,
        NC. Mrs. Starkey's letters to her benefactor Kinsley include comments on the activities of
        Kinsley's brother, who was an officer in the U.S. Army, and on the charitable work in New
        Bern. They also illustrate some of the problems confronting an African American family
        during the war years.</p>
      <p>Among the notable correspondents in this collection are John Albion Andrew, governor of
        Massachusetts (1861-1866) and supporter of African American participation in the Union Army;
        William Claflin, industrialist, philanthropist, and governor of Massachusetts (1869-1872);
        Edward Everett, renowned orator and earlier governor of Massachusetts; Julia Ward Howe,
        author, poet, and abolitionist; Mary Tyler Peabody, education reformer and author; Carl
        Schurz, German reformer, statesman, Senator, and general in the Union Army; James Monroe
        Trotter, African American lieutenant in the Union Army (55th Massachusetts), teacher, and
        federal employee; Edward Augustus Wild, doctor and Brigadier General in the Union Army (35th
        Massachusetts), and officials of the N.Y. and New England Railroad Company. </p>
      <p>Other items include correspondence from the Provost Marshal's Office, New Bern, N.C.;
        correspondence and five receipts from the New England Soldier's Relief Association; one
        letter from the office of the SATURDAY EVENING GAZETTE, Boston, with a reference to James
        Robert Gilmore's visit to Jefferson Davis; one letter from Samuel May, Jr., abolitionist and
        Unitarian minister; and one letter concerning Kinsley's friend Mrs. Wild.</p>

      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Edward Wilkinson Kinsley (1829-1891) was a partner in the Boston, Massachusetts importing
        firm of Horswell, Kinsley and French. Born in Nashua, New Hampshire, he moved to Boston in
        1848; he died there in 1891.</p>
      <p>Kinsley never sought public office and declined permanent government appointments until
        1873 when Governor William B. Washburn of Massachusetts selected him as a state director of
        the New York and New England Railroad Company. Kinsley served in his state's militia, but he
        received a medical exemption from service in the Army on Nov. 11, l862.</p>
      <p>Kinsley was well connected in Boston, expecially with those who shared his humanitarian
        interests. The papers in this collection indicate that he was concerned about the plight of
        the free African Americans in the South during both the Civil war and Reconstruction. His
        activities extended to soliciting funds for societies aiding freed slaves, lobbying for
        Congressional action to grant equal pay to African American volunteer soldiers serving in
        the Union Army, and personal assistance to former slaves. </p>
      <p>Kinsley worked closely with his friend John Albion Andrew, wartime governor of Mass., to
        secure Congressional approval of a bill designed not only to begin paying African American
        troops, but also to make the payments retroactive to cover the volunteer's full period of
        service. At the request of Governor Andrew, Kinsley traveled to Union-occupied North
        Carolina in 1863 to help recruit African American regiments.</p>
      <p>After the Civil War, Kinsley evidently supported Ulysses S. Grant at first, but later
        shifted his allegiances during the closing years of Reconstruction.</p>
