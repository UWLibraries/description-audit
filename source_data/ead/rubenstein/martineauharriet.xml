      <abstract id="aspace_7e82614e2c6c6aee62ca2b50aca77ac2">Harriet Martineau was a British social
        theorist and Whig writer, often cited as the first female sociologist. Collection comprises
        21 letters written by Harriet Martineau from Ambleside between 1868 and 1876, primarily to
        Mr. (John?) Robinson, with one letter to Prime Minister Gladstone regarding her rejection of
        a pension (1873 June 3). A few letters are incomplete. In addition, there are four undated
        fragments of letters. Topics include the republishing of her biographical sketches
        originally published in the Daily Mail; scandals of the period, particularly the Harriet
        Beecher Stowe-Lady Byron scandal and the John Stuart Mill and Harriet Taylor scandal, along
        with Martineau's associated writings; re-publication of Eastern Life: Present &amp; Past and
        her holding of copyright; the 2nd edition of Traditions of Palestine; and the autobiography
        of Brougham and its errors about Martineau and her family, which she wishes corrected in the
        Daily News. Other topics include liberal politics, religion, her declining health and need
        of a companion and servants, her rejection of a pension, and planned meetings with Robinson,
        as well as condolences sent on the death of his son. There is an additional letter written
        on behalf of Martineau by Miss Goodwin to an unidentified addressee, regarding politics and
        Martineau's health (1873 February 20).</abstract>

      <p>Harriet Martineau was a British social theorist and Whig writer, often cited as the first
        female sociologist. Martineau wrote many books and a multitude of essays from a
        sociological, holistic, religious, domestic, and feminine perspective; she also translated
        various works by Auguste Comte. She earned enough to support herself entirely by her
        writing.</p>
