        photographs, 5 cartes-de-visite photographs and a clipping regarding Martha Maxwell. The
        cartes-de-visite photographs feature full-length portraits of Maxwell, two seated at her
        taxidermy work and three standing while holding a gun. Several of the stereographic
        photographs are also portraits, most often showing Maxwell positioned within displays of her
        taxidermy birds and mammals; however, the majority of the stereographs depict her displays
        at the Centennial Exhibition and at the Rocky Mountain Museum in Boulder. The clipping
        describes the birds and mammals represented at her Centennial Exhibition display and
        provides a review of her work.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Martha Maxwell, also known as "The Colorado Huntress," was an American naturalist, hunter,
        taxidermist, and author. She was born in Pennsylvania, and moved to Colorado as a bride.
        After seeing the work of a local taxidermist, she studied the art and began accompanying her
        husband on hunting trips. After shooting native birds and mammals, she prepared them for
        exhibit by reconstructing their frames in plaster and stretching the treated skins over
        them. Her display was so celebrated that she was invited to show her pieces at the
        Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia.</p>
