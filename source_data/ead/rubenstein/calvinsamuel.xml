         <p>Samuel Calvin (1811-1890) was a lawyer, member of the 31st Congress (March 1849-March
            1851), and member of the Pennsylvania State Constitutional Convention of 1873. Calvin
            was admitted to the bar in 1836; he established his practice at Hollidaysburg, Pa.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Personal correspondence and legal papers of Samuel Calvin. Main items of the collection
            are: letters pertaining to local and state "Whig" politics in Pa., 1846-1851 especially;
            letters, reports, and maps concerning the Rico Reduction and Mining Co. of Rico,
            Colorado (1881-1883); ledgers and daybook of the Allegheny Force and the Rebecca Furnace
            Co. of Hollidaysburg, Blair Co., Pa. (1849-1857) and letters concerning the business of
            the company; letters and notices relating to transportation in Pa. by railroads, canals,
            and roads (for example, letters of 1851 Feb. 10; 1855 July 24; 1856 Feb. 21-22; and
            notice of 1836 Feb. 17); letters by Robert Williams and others in Iowa regarding
            westward expansion, roads to the West, and prices of land in Iowa (for example, letter
            of 1853 Oct. 18 and land tax receipts for 1856-1857); a series of letters from 1859
            written by Lorin Blodget, Thomas B. Lincoln, and Samuel Calvin (son-in-law of John A.
            Blodget) with reference to a plan for recovering real estate in Washington, D.C.,
            formerly own by Samuel Blodget (1757-1814), noted Washington architect and land
            speculator; numerous bills and receipts; and legal documents. The collection is
            strongest for the years 1838-1883. There are about 15 letters in the collection written
            by Samuel Calvin.</p>
         <p>For the years before 1846, the collection consists largely of letters to Calvin from
            persons desiring legal aid in the collection of debts. In addition, there is an
            interesting 13-page letter by William Smith, written from Philadelphia on 1793 Oct. 22,
            regarding the cholera epidemic in that city. Also, legal documents are abundant. These
            include indentures; wills; accounts of settlements of estates; a commission of
            bankruptcy (1803); powers of attorney; articles of agreement (business contracts); a
            paper of apprenticeship (1839); citizenship papers (1838 and 1840); mortgages; court
            dockets (Courts of Common Pleas of Huntington and Blair counties); written statements of
            witnesses in civil and criminal cases; printed copies of the record in certain cases
            argued by Calvin. Such legal documents will be found throughout the collection. Other
            items are: a plan of Hollidaysburg, Pa. (1840); bills and receipts (foodstuffs, fabrics,
            hardware, medicines, and drugs); a copy of the constitution of the Old Warrior and Clay
            Club of Hollidaysburg (1844), with 148 signatures and the minutes of the meetings, March
            through August, 1844; a map of Texas drawn by the U.S. War Department (1844); a copy of
            the Williamsport <title type="simple" render="italic">Lycoming Free Press</title> (1836
            July 9).</p>
         <p>For the period 1846-1851, the correspondence bears upon details of Calvin's election to
            Congress in 1848, matters of patronage and other services to his constituents once he
            entered into office (especially military pension applications), Calvin's decision not to
            be a candidate in 1850, and issues from Blair Co., Pa., in particular. A series of
            letters in early 1846 concern measures taken to assure the passage through the Senate of
            a bill forming Blair Co. out of Bedford and Huntington counties. </p>
         <p>Some reference is made in the letters to problems and politics. Letters from 1848
            suggest Josiah Randall of Philadelphia as an excellent man for a position in President
            Taylor's cabinet. Several letters to Calvin in 1850-1851 contain references to the
            tariff, particularly advising increased dutied on iron. A long letter of 1850 July 11
            concerns the Compromise of 1850, with the writer predicting that if the compromise
            failed and California were admitted to the Union, the result would be "disunion and
            civil war." A letter from 1860 March 2 states that people were much in favor of the
            Kansas-Nebraska Act, and that slavery, not the tariff, was the primary political
            issue.</p>
         <p>Calvin expressed his views on slavery and its expansion into the territories in a letter
            from 1848 Oct. 3: he was, he wrote, opposed to slavery as an institution in general, and
            to the Missouri Compromise in particular. Miscellaneous items of this type include:
            notes of lectures (1850) and drafts and printed copies (1860) of speeches given by
            Calvin on the subject of the tariff; copies of supplements of the Hollidaysburg Register
            (1880 June 16 and Oct. 1) containing articles written by Calvin on the currency
            question.</p>
         <p>Numerous references (1859-1860, 1867) in the letters to Calvin's participation in state
            politics and elections after 1861 show that he remained influential in Pa. There is no
            indication, however, of his role in the state constitutional convention of 1872-1873.
            Nor does the Civil War receive mention. There is a muster roll of the 2nd Regt., Pa.
            Vols (1847), stationed in Mexico. A letter of 1867 Oct. 30 speaks enthusiastically of
            the potential development of Washington, D.C., after the Civil War as a commercial and
            industrial center.</p>
         <p>Noticeable are Calvin's business activities after 1850. He invested money in a great
            variety of new enterprises: Patton's Ville and Woodberry Turnpike Road Co. (1854);
            Morrison's Cove Turnpike Road Co. (1852); Hollidaysburg and Bedford Plank Road Co.
            (1853); Hollidaysburg Altoona Plank Road Co. (1854); Juniata Steam Boat Co. (1864);
            Hollidaysburg Gas Co. (1856); Hollidaysburg and Bennington Railroad and Mining Co. The
            collection contains 2 mortgages (1864) of this last company, as well as Calvin's shares
            in most of the others. In 1856 he purchased lands in Hardin and Muscatine counties,
            Iowa. He sold these properties in 1866-1867, evidently for a large profit. Calvin was
            interested in mining, primarily, and therefore in lands containing mineral deposits.</p>
         <p>A series of letters (1881 Oct.-1883 Dec.) concern the Rico Reduction and Mining Co.
            Samuel Calvin was vice-president. Letters from Rico, Co., report on the wealth of
            silver, salt, and sulphur deposits in that area; describe the processes used for the
            mining and smelting of silver; discuss expenses and profits, labor problems, incidents
            in the life of a mining camp, and legal troubles with claims. The collection also
            includes maps, deeds, and charters from the Rico Reduction and Mining Co., as well as
            income and special tax receipts for Calvin from the year 1863-1871.</p>
         <p>Miscellaneous items in the collection include: single copies of various newspapers;
            printed materials and circulars; small account books; maps of land holdings in Pa.;
            clippings.</p>
