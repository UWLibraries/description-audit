         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The color photographs and oral histories in the Five Farms: Stories From American Farm
            Families collection form part of a multimedia project carried out under the auspices of
            the Center for Documentary Studies. Beginning in March 2008, photographers Alix Lowrey
            Blair, Andrew Lewis, Tom Rankin, Elena Rue, and Steve Schapiro, along with audio
            specialists Ben Adler, Rob Dillard, Camille Lacapa, Susannah Lee, and John Biewen, each
            visited an American farm and documented the farm families' experiences over the course
            of a year. The locations for the Five Farms series are: a family farm on the Hopi
            Reservation in northeastern Arizona; an organic farm in California's Capay Valley; a
            dairy farm in western Massachusetts; a diversified farm in central Iowa; and an African
            American-owned hog farm in eastern North Carolina. Details on each farm are found in the
            series descriptions in this collection guide. </p>
         <p>The photographs in the collection, chosen for the 2009 project exhibit, portray farmers
            and family members, farm workers, farm animals, and landscapes. The first set of 25
            13x16-inch color digital prints, five from each photographer, is accompanied by a second
            set of 25 prints of the same images, but in varying sizes ranging from 12 1/8 x 17
            inches to 13 3/8 x 20 inches. All prints are arranged and foldered by geographical
            location. The photographer's names are written on the back of all the prints, and the
            captions are also included on the backs of the prints in the first set.</p>
         <p>The oral history interviews and short sound files, over 100 hours of recordings, provide
            many details on the lives of the families, typical activities on each farm, the local
            culture and natural environments, and thoughts of individuals on the past, present, and
            the future. Also included are digital files containing ambient sounds, theme music, and
            credits, all used in a five-part Public Media radio program broadcast in July 2009.
            Although most of the files are currently stored in .wav format, there are also a
            handfule of mp3 files.</p>
         <p>The Five Farms project culminated in an exhibit from April 27-August 21, 2009 at Duke
            University's Center for Documentary Studies; other outreach included a multimedia
            website and programs on public radio stations nationwide.</p>

                  <p>Photographs by Andrew Lewis. The Pecusa family is Hopi and Pima from the
                     village of Bacavi on the Hopi Reservation in northeastern Arizona. Their
                     immediate family has been farming in the area for at least four generations.
                     Before them, ancestral people farmed their land intermittently for nearly a
                     thousand years. The Pecusa family farms in a largely traditional manner, using
                     little farm machinery and employing ancient dry land farming practices that
                     allow them to grow corn in an arid environment that receives only eight to
                     twelve inches of rain per year.</p>
                  <p>When not farming, Davis Pecusa also serves on the Hopi Tribal Council. The Hopi
                     Tribe recognized Davis recently as "Farmer of the Year." His son, David, has
                     studied under him for as long as he can remember and recently has begun to
                     study western organic and permaculture farming practices. He also has a strong
                     interest in the growing and preservation of heirloom native seeds from the
                     Southwest. David will soon be leaving his job as kitchen manager at Hotevilla
                     Bacavi Day School so that he can pursue his farming interest full-time. His
                     dream is to teach and introduce younger generations to farming and sustainable
                     living practices.</p>

                  <p>Photographs by Alix Lowrey Blair. Jeff and Annie Main own Good Humus Produce,
                     which they run with their three children, Zachary, Alison, and Claire, and a
                     small crew of employees. The Mains started their twenty-acre, certified organic
                     farm in 1976, shortly after their graduation from the University of California
                     at Davis. On their farm, located in the rural hills of Hungry Hollow, near
                     Capay, California (about an hour northwest of Sacramento), they grow about
                     sixty different fruits and vegetables, as well as herbs and flowers. They
                     deliver to farmers' markets, to area subscribers through a program known as
                     Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), and to wholesalers in the Bay Area.</p>

                  <p>Photographs by Elena Rue. Craig and LaVon Griffieon operate a diversified,
                     1,100-acre farm with beef, chickens, turkeys, pigs, sheep, and horses in
                     Ankeny, Iowa, north of Des Moines. Their farm has been in the Griffieon family
                     since 1868. Craig and Lavon raise corn, soybeans, oats, and alfalfa. Their
                     Limousin beef herd comes from stock that has been on their farm since 1960.
                     Their children-Autumn, Nick, Phillip, and Julia-are the sixth Griffieon
                     generation to farm there. The Griffieon children are active in all phases of
                     the farm, and have themselves raised pastured poultry for ten years.</p>

                  <p>Photographs by Steve Schapiro. The Hager Brothers Farm is set on more than 700
                     acres of rugged, hilly terrain in Colrain, Massachusetts. Chip and Sherry Hager
                     run the farm, along with daughter Kim and son-in-law Aaron, and another son,
                     Todd. Both Kim and Aaron - college graduates with degrees in agriculture -
                     bring to their passion for farming a new understanding of the science of dairy
                     herd management. The family continually merges traditional and innovative
                     approaches to dairy farming.</p>

                  <p>Photographs by Tom Rankin. Eddie and Dorothy Wise raise hogs on 106 acres near
                     Whitakers, in east-central North Carolina. Eddie is a fourth-generation hog
                     farmer but the first to own a farm; his father and grandfather were
                     sharecroppers. During a career in the military, and as an ROTC instructor at
                     Howard and Georgetown Universities, Eddie raised hogs in his spare time. It was
                     his dream to return home to North Carolina and farm full-time. When he retired
                     from the Army in 1991 at the age of forty-eight, that's what he set out to do.
                     Dorothy Wise grew up in Washington, D.C., but she too hoped to one day live on
                     a farm. When she and Eddie met at Howard University in the 1980s and she
                     discovered he was a farmer, it seemed that her wish had come true.</p>
