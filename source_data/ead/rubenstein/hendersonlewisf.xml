                  <p>Letter contains a good description of the final days of the war, and
                     Henderson's impression of the rapid decline of the Confederate cause. Also
                     includes comments on Lincoln's second inauguration ceremonies in Washington,
                     soldier pay and lifestyles, Philadelphia, etc. The letter notes that one of
                     Henderson's friends (from the North) had joined the Confederate cause, fighting
                     for the army and being captured at the Battle of Franklin. Henderson also
                     discusses desertions from the Union army and executions "almost every day, the
                     culprits being principally from the 10th Connecticut...." He also mentions the
                     desertions of Confederate troops, and claims that Georgians and Virginians are
                     more likely to desert, while South Carolinians were considered more loyal and
                     reliable.</p>
