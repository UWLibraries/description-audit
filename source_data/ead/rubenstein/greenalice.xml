      <p>Alice Stopford Green (1847-1929) was an Irish historian, activist, and politician. A native
        of County Meath, Green was an active participant in the Irish nationalist movement, as well
        as in the movement against English colonial policies in Africa. She was one of the first
        women elected to the Irish Senate in 1922. Her home in Dublin where she spent the last ten
        years of her life served as as an intellectual hub. Green is the author of eight history
        books, including In The Making of Ireland and its Undoing (1908), which is credited with
        contradicting the English belief that there was no native Irish civilization. Her book Irish
        Nationality (1911), was published on the cusp of the birth of the Irish Republic.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Green writes to an unidentified male editor or publisher ("Dear Sir"), to decline his
        invitation to write an article for a forthcoming book. She writes that she is "overwhelmed
        by work this winter," and that "the subject of the American Irish is almost unknown to me
        and it would need a considerable time and reading to write anything worthy of your
        insertion." In conclusion, she writes that she is "keeping in view the idea of getting some
        work done which may draw attention to your publications." Written on letterhead: 36
        Grosvenor Road, Westminster.</p>
