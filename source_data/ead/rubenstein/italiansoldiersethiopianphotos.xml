            album maintained by an Italian soldier stationed in Ethiopia during the Second
            Italo-Ethiopian War and the subsequent Italian occupation of the region. The soldier is
            unidentified, but his name may be the one that is embossed on the lower right-hand
            corner of the album's leather cover. On the first page of the album is a postcard
            announcing the Italian troop's victorious entry into Addis Ababa. Comprises 133
            black-and-white photographs, ranging in size from 2"x1" to 4.75"x6", of the A.O.I.
            (Africa Orientale Italiana). The photographs are divided into groups by city, and many
            have captions written in Italian. Cities and other locations mentioned include Axum,
            Scire, Gondar, Cheren, Asmara, Lake Tana, Adua, and Addis Ababa, among others. In
            addition to images of military maneuvers, there are photographs of social customs and
            conditions (markets, native buildings, hairdos, priests, pilgrims, ceremonies, families,
            etc.), wildlife, and landscapes.</abstract>
