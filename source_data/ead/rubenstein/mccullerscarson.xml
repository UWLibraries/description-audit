      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Carson McCullers, born Lula Carson Smith, was an American author of novels, short stories,
        plays, and poetry. She was born in Columbus, Georgia, in 1917, and studied piano as a child.
        When she was 15, she had rheumatic fever, an illness that caused her to have strokes
        throughout her life (beginning in her 20s), and that contributed to her choosing writing
        over a career in music. She left Georgia for New York City in 1934, where she began taking
        creative writing classes at Columbia University and New York University. Her first short
        story, Wunderkind, was published in 1936.</p>
      <p>In 1940 Carson McCullers published The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, a novel written in the
        Southern Gothic tradition. Subsequent works included Reflections in a Golden Eye (1941), The
        Member of the Wedding (1946), The Ballad of the Sad Cafe (1951), The Square Root of
        Wonderful (1957), and Clock without Hands (1961). Several of her works were adapted for the
        stage and/or film. </p>
      <p>In 1937 Carson married Reeves McCullers. Carson and Reeves' marriage was tumultuous. They
        both struggled with alcoholism and depression, and their relationship was perhaps
        complicated by Reeves' own literary ambitions and by their romantic attachments to other
        people (both Reeves and Carson were bisexual). </p>
      <p>In 1941 Carson divorced Reeves, moving to New York and eventually to Paris after World War
        II, where she was friends with Tennessee Williams and Truman Capote. She remarried Reeves
        McCullers in 1945. In Paris in 1953 Reeves tried to convince her to agree to a suicide pact;
        she fled, and he killed himself by taking sleeping pills.</p>
      <p>After suffering several strokes, Carson lived with her mother and sister in Nyack, New
        York. She died of a brain hemorrhage at age 50 in 1967.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Carson McCullers Papers span the years 1941-1995 and are divided into six series:
        Correspondence, Writings, Jordan Massee Notebooks, Photographs, Printed Materials, and
        Clippings. The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> includes numerous letters
        from Carson McCullers to Jordan Massee, Paul Bigelow, Edith Sitwell, and other friends and
        family members. Most significant in the series is the correspondence between McCullers and
        Tennessee Williams, in which both writers touch on a variety of topics such as the writing
        process, health, marital problems, and their travels. Carson's relationship with her
        husband, Reeves McCullers, is a frequent topic.</p>
      <p> The <emph render="bold">Writings Series</emph>, the largest in the collection, comprises
        typewritten manuscripts of several long as well as short published works of McCullers,
        including <title type="simple" render="italic">The Member of the Wedding</title> (which has
        handwritten revisions) and <title type="simple" render="italic">The Clock Without
          Hands</title>. Notable short writings include verses that McCullers wrote for children, an
        essay on literary criticism, and two short works that are inscribed and signed by the
        author. At the end of the series there are also two poems by Edith Sitwell. </p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Jordan Massee Notebooks Series</emph> contains a catalogue that
        Massee compiled about the McCullers papers he owned, as well as a notebook with notes about
        McCullers and extracts from his journals. </p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Photographs Series</emph> consists of five photographs, most of
        which are of Carson McCullers. Particularly noteworthy is a photograph taken by Henri
        Cartier-Bresson, where McCullers appears with the editor of Harper's Bazaar, George
        Davis.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Printed Materials Series</emph> and the <emph render="bold"
          >Clippings Series</emph> both contain reviews of writings by McCullers and materials
        related to their dramatization. The latter series includes two short essays by Tennessee
        Williams as well as numerous obituaries published after McCullers's death.</p>

          <p>The largest component of the series is the typewritten manuscript of <title
              type="simple" render="italic">The Member of the Wedding</title>, with the author's
            hand-written corrections. There are numerous variants for certain portions of the novel
            and material not used in the published version. The series also contains a copy of the

            which was sent at the request of McCullers to Jordan Massee by Robert Lantz of Robin

              render="italic">The Member of the Wedding</title>, as well as published and
            unpublished short pieces written by McCullers. Among these are an essay by McCullers
            entitled <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Russian Realists and Southern
              Writers</title>; her contemplation on the writing process; a collection of verses for

          <p>Contains two notebooks compiled in 1974 by Jordan Massee, a cousin and close friend of
            Carson McCullers, as well as a brief recapitulation that was added three years later.
            The first notebook is a catalog of the Carson McCullers collection Massee owned; the
            second notebook consists of excerpts from Massee's journals, 1949-1965, and his
            household account book for 1956. This volume also contains an introduction by Massee
            written in 1974, a list of Carson's visits to his apartment in New York in 1957, notes
            concerning the funeral arrangements for Carson, and his recollections of a conversation
            with Truman Capote about Carson in July 1965.</p>
