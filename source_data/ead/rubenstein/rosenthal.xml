      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Mel Rosenthal (1940-2017) was a documentary photographer based in New York City and
        director of photographic programs at SUNY-Empire State beginning in 1975. Born in the Bronx,
        his family moved to South Carolina for a time but returned to the Bronx where he grew3 up.
        He is best known for his images taken in his old neighborhood. He published <title
          render="italic">In the South Bronx of America</title> in 2000. </p>
      <p>Always interested in refugees and immigrants and how they managed life in the United
        States, he started a project around 2000 about the experiences of Arab Americans, and
        exhibited the portraits shortly afer the 2001 terrorist attacks partly in an effort to
        counteract blind prejudice against them. </p>
      <p>Rosenthal received degrees from City College and the University of Connecticut, and he
        first took up the camera professionally as a medical photographer in Tanzania. Subsequently,
        his photography mainly focused on his home base in New York City. However, other projects
        took him to other U.S. states, and to Vietnam, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Puerto Rico. He died in
        New York City in 2017.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection consists of 80 black-and-white photographs taken by New York City native Mel
        Rosenthal, stemming from two documentary projects. The first documents the destruction by
        arson of an entire South Bronx neighborhood in New York City in the 1970s, with images of
        burned-out buildings and inhabitants who were forced to abandon their homes. The
        neighborhood is the same one where Rosenthal grew up, and the series features a portrait of
        Mel Rosenthal in his old bedroom.</p>
      <p>The second project examines the daily lives of Arab Americans, including men, women and
        children of Syrian, Egyptian, Moroccan, Algerian, Jordanian and Palestinian descent, in New
        York State in the early 2000s. Scenes include images of children, professionals,
        neighborhood life, and the religious lives of Christians, Muslims, Greek Orthodox,
        Maronites, Jews and Coptics. It was exhibited shortly after the 2001 terrorist attacks.</p>
      <p>Selected images in the Rosenthal collection were exhibited at Duke University and these
        available online. The gelatin silver prints measure 11x14 and 16x20 inches. Exhibit prints
        in their mats measure 16x20 and 20x24 inches.</p>
      <p>Also included are some publicity items for exhibits and workshops on documentary
        photography, a music CD with photography by Rosenthal, and an audiocassette recording of
        Rosenthal speaking at an exhibit opening in 2004. </p>
      <p>Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</p>

                the hundreds of burnt-out and sealed-up buildings that line the Cross Bronx
                Expressway. The decals would portray neat drapery, flowerpots, and window boxes,
                intimations of comfortable and happy domestic scenes. That way, commuters who passed
                through the Bronx en route to Westchester, Long Island, or the Connecticut executive

                The Bronx has prime real estate that is affordable. No inflated prices like
                Westchester, New Jersey, or Long Island. The City of New York is planning to sell
                prime parcels of real estate for retail, light manufacturing, office and industrial
                development. These are properties which the city has held from sale until the market
                was right. Now the market is right. You can own real estate in thriving, busy
                commercial centers, industrial enclaves, and growing residential
                areas.</title>--<title render="doublequote">The Bronx: Business's Best Kept

            <p>I showed the Rabbi a letter of introduction from the Museum of the City of New York
              which said that they had commissioned me to photograph for them an exhibition about
              Arab American life in New York. They told me that I was in the wrong place because
              they were not Arabs. They insisted that they were Sephardic and should be called that.
              I pointed out to them that they spoke Arabic and were from a country which spoke
              Arabic and therefore could be considered Arabs. They weren't convinced, but it turned
              out that they did not have the tenth Jewish man that makes a ritual possible in the
              Jewish religion and there I was, the tenth man. So I got to celebrate Chanukah and to
              photograph them also. Later because so many people took umbrage to being called an
              Arab I changed the letter to say that I was photographing Arabic speaking people and
              thus avoided problems. As with the case of many of the Christian Arabic speaking
              people, many seem to equate "Arab" with being Muslim and they did not want to be
              associated with that identification. September 11th made that even more
              pronounced.</p>

              them that. I asked them what they called themselves and they said they were
              Phoenicians. Having learned from the Moroccans, I said it was fine, and that this was
              a project about Arabic speaking people. I looked up Phoenicia in an Encyclopedia and
              they had a drawing of where Phoenicia had been and it was what now is Syria and

            <p>A fitting at Four Golden Needles, a dress shop in Bay Ridge Brooklyn which was
              created and owned by four Palestinian women. The woman trying on the dress is from

            <p>Widdi's is known throughout the Arab American community as the place to have your
              party after Ramadan, your wedding, your confirmation party, your fund raising party,
              or your political meeting of the community. Gold coins are traditional wedding
              presents which are pinned to the bride's dress at the marriage ceremony. It is common
              for the women to wear strings of gold coins minted in the Mid-East around their heads
              and their waists on special occasions such as this wedding. One man when I asked about

            <p>He is the spitting image of one my cousins when we were younger. As I looked around
              the room filled with Palestinians it struck me that many of the people there looked

            <p>I liked this photograph, but it was not in the exhibition of my work, because the
              museum directors thought it inflammatory. I thought they were being overly cautious,
              but it was soon after the attack on the towers and many people were upset and so I
              lost the argument.</p>

            <p>Debbie Almontaser, an educator and activist, carried a photograph of her son wherever
              she went. He was in the National Guard patrolling the area around Ground Zero and
              couldn't go to the Peace Vigil, September 16, 2001. After September 11th a number of
              people in Brooklyn Heights called her names and tried to get her to take off her
              hijab. She started to carry the photograph of her son who had been called up to the
              National Guard on September 11th. She told the people that were harassing her that he
              was in the National Guard patrolling the area around Ground Zero and that she was as
              patriotic as they were. She told me that the harassment was so bad that teachers at
              the public school where she worked had to escort her to school and back. Shortly
              after, she resigned from teaching there.</p>
