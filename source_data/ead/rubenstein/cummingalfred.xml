         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Alfred Cumming was born in 1802 in Augusta, Georgia. As Mayor of the city of Augusta, he
            achieved prominence by his active work in curbing a yellow fever epidemic. In May 1857,
            President James Buchanan appointed him the second Governor of Utah Territory, following
            Brigham Young. His trip West took several months and included a winter near Fort
            Bridger. He finally arrived in Utah with his wife, Elizabeth, in the spring of 1858. At
            the time, the territory was in conflict as the Mormon settlers resisted federal
            interference regarding slavery, polygamy, and states' rights. He was fairly successful
            in quieting the situation, and was backed up by an army detachment under Albert Sidney
            Johnston. </p>
         <p>At the end of his four-year term, Cumming returned to Washington, D.C. His return to
            Augusta was postponed by the Civil War, and he arrived there the summer of 1864. His
            wife died in 1867; Alfred died in 1873.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Family and political correspondence of William Clay Cumming; Thomas Cumming; and Alfred
            Cumming (1802-1873), participant in the "Mormon War," 1857-1861, with material on Mormon
            history and frontier and pioneer life. Letters of William Clay Cumming, brother of
            Alfred Cumming, 1805-1818, contain mention of books read and studied at Princeton
            College, Princeton, New Jersey, in 1805; description of studies, living arrangements,
            and teachers in the Litchfield Law School, operated at Litchfield, Connecticut, by
            Tapping Reeve; accounts of violent opposition to Federalism in New England; description
            of climate and countryside around Litchfield; participation of William Clay Cumming's
            brother, Joseph, in disturbances at Princeton College, 1807; his activities in the War
            of 1812 as commander of a company in Florida, campaigns in New York as a colonel,
            criticisms of officers, a dispute with General George Izard, adoption of a system of
            discipline for the infantry; description of a trip in 1815 from New York to New Orleans
            with accounts of Louisville, Lexington, and the Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, Asheville,
            North Carolina, Nashville, Tennessee, Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana; a few
            comments on Brazil and Uruguay, which he visited in 1816; and mention of John McDonogh.
            A series of letters by Elizabeth Wells (Randall) Cumming to members of her family
            describes the arduous trip to Utah, scenery, frontier conditions, and Indian troubles.
            The collection includes hints of discrepancies in Cumming's account with the U.S.
            government while territorial governor. Included also are nine volumes: journal of an
            expedition to the Blackfoot Indians with notes and instructions, 1855; two letter books
            and official proceedings of a commission to hold council with Blackfoot and other Indian
            tribes, 1855; two letterpress copy books, 1857-1861, 1859-1860, containing copies of
            letters to government officials, and to James Buchanan, Lewis Cass, Howell Cobb, John B.
            Floyd, A. S. Johnston, and Brigham Young; and four scrapbooks containing news paper
            clippings and broadsides. Among the correspondents are W. W. Bibb, J. S. Black, James
            Buchanan, Lewis Cass, Alfred Cumming, J. B. Floyd, Albert Sidney Johnston, William
            Medill, B. F. Perry, Franklin Pierce, Alexander H. Stephens, G. M. Troup, and Brigham
            Young.</p>
