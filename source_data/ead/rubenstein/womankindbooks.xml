      <p>Carole de Bra Powell opened Womankind Books, the first feminist bookstore in Nashville,
        Tennessee, in 1977. The store also served as a distributor for Olivia Records and produced
        music concerts. Associated initiatives included the Womankind Support Project, a local
        umbrella organization that worked to improve the quality of life for Nashville women,
        including the Womankind Health Center, which was established to offer gynecological and
        mental health care services. Powell closed Womankind Books in 1984, when she moved to
        Chicago.</p>
