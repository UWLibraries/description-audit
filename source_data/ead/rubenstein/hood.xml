         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>George Henry Hood was a resident of Chelsea, Essex County, Mass., and a rubber goods
            salesman and businessman during the latter half of the 19th century. Prior to the Civil
            War, Hood was employed at Winslow, Hood and Co. of Boston, a firm which wholesaled
            boots, shoes, and shoemaker's tools.</p>
         <p>During at least part of the Civil War (1861) Hood was a travelling sales representative
            for Rubber Clothing Company, a firm based in Boston and New York that specialized in
            providing military equipment. He also sold rubber goods for a number of other firms
            during the war while travelling to St. Louis, New York, Washington, D.C., and other
            places.</p>
         <p>After the war, Hood went into various other business ventures before founding the Boston
            Rubber Company in 1877, which eventually merged with the United States Rubber Company in
            1892.</p>
         <p>Hood married Henrietta ("Etta") Janvrin in Sentember 1859. They had several children,
            including Helen, a musical child prodigy who became a composer. In 1896, two of Hood's
            sons, Arthur Needham Hood (1868-1950) and F. C. Hood formed the Hood Rubber Company in
            Boston where Hood retained an office at least until 1912.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The papers of George Henry Hood span the years 1857 to 1895, although the bulk of the
            material falls in the period 1861 to 1863. It consists primarily of correspondence
            between Hood and his wife <emph render="doublequote">Etta</emph> written while he was
            travailing on business selling rubber goods for a variety of firms, including the
            Beverly Rubber Company of Beverly, Mass., and the Rubber Clothing Company of New York
            and Boston. There are also a few letters from other family members and business
            associates and some miscellaneous items. The letters indicate that Hood's travels took
            him to Philadelphia (1861), St. Louis (1862), New York (1862-1863), Washington, D.C.
            (1861-1863), and other places. Letters from St. Louis and Washington, in particular,
            contain some observations on Civil War activity in those places.</p>
         <p>The correspondence is primarily of a personal nature, dealing with family matters and
            the mutual concerns of a husband and wife about being separated during his business
            trips. A few letters relate to Hood's daughter Helen.</p>

         <head>Arrangement Note</head>
         <p>The papers of George Henry Hood are organized into a single, chronologically arranged
            file of correspondence. Miscellaneous items are so few and insignificant that they have
            been interfiled with the correspondence. Preceding that file is an information folder
            containing biographical information about several of the correspondents found in the
            collection, including Helen Hood, and photocopies of pages from several Boston city
            directories indicating Hood's business interests in that area.</p>
