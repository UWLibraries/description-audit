         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>In April 1941 Stanley B. Resor, then president of the J. Walter Thompson Company (JWT),
            outlined the advertising industry's role in the coming conflict. In an article published
            in New York City Sunday newspapers, he spoke of advertising agencies' two goals: to keep
            consumers purchasing goods in order to help offset war expenses, and to relate the <emph
               render="doublequote">truths</emph> behind the government's policies and programs. </p>
         <p>The J. Walter Thompson Company (JWT) contributed to the war effort during World War II
            in two ways: by creating ads supporting government policies, and by granting its
            employees time off for their own war work. JWT's government accounts included the War
            Manpower Commission, handled by Helen Lansdowne Resor and James Webb Young; the Naval
            Aviation Cadet program, handled by Sam Meek; Woman Power, handled by William E.
            Berchtold; and the U.S. Cadet Nurse Corps, developed by Ruth Waldo and handled by Thayer
            Jaccaci. In each of these accounts, as in most campaigns formulated for the government,
            sponsors in private industry were sought. For instance, advertisements for the U.S.
            Cadet Nurse Corps were sponsored by the Eastman Kodak Company. In addition to the
            sponsorship of government advertising programs, clients adjusted their own campaigns to
            reflect America's war-time conditions. Advertising campaigns were also formulated for
            religious and charitable organizations. Both the British War Relief Society and the Navy
            Relief Society benefitted from the advertising expertise of J. Walter Thompson Company
            personnel. International offices of the Company became involved in a number of ways. The
            London Office, for example, prepared a conservation program for the Ministry of Food,
            while the Australian Office implemented an Australian-American goodwill campaign. </p>
         <p> Company personnel were granted leaves of absence or time for civilian work of
            importance to the war. Among these were James Webb Young, chair of the War Advertising
            Council, tyhe predecessor to the Advertising Council; Samuel W. Meek, consultant to the
            Navy Department; and Walter O'Meara, Deputy Administrator for Information, Office of
            Price Administration. Those who remained in the office devoted some of their time and
            talent to aiding such organizations as the Camp Shows for Service Men, the Citizen
            United for Democracy, and the National War Fund.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The J. Walter Thompson Company World War II Advertising Collection documents the
            war-related activities of the J. Walter Thompson Company (JWT) advertising agency during
            1940-1948, including a few post-war assessments. In particular, it shows JWTâ€™s
            contributions to the war effort by its in-house documentation and work on government,
            civilian, and war-supporting charitable organization accounts. Materials include lists,
            memos, press releases, correspondence, notes, and advertisement tearsheets and proofs.
            Many of the materials in this collection are products of campaigns conducted under the
            auspices of the War Advertising Council, as well as those sponsored by civilian clients.
            These advertisements and pamphlets supported food rationing, fuel and rubber
            conservation, the purchase of War Bonds, the United Services Organization (USO),
            military recruitment, and women's employment in war-related jobs. Other advertisements
            arose from JWT's work in 1941 and 1942 for the Navy Relief Society. Items produced by
            the JWT London Office supported British War Relief (Ministry of Food, 1940-1941) and the
            Food Facts series (recipes and cooking tips for foods available despite rationing). </p>
         <p>The collection includes corporate-sponsored advertisements relating to the war effort.
            Companies represented include: the American Association of Playing Card Manufacturers
            (recreation for convalescent service-men, in cooperation with the Red Cross); Anthracite
            Industries, Inc. (fuel conservation); Eastman Kodak Company (U.S. Cadet Nurse Corps);
            and the Institute of Life Insurance (ads to fight inflation produced in cooperation with
            the Office of Economic Stabilization, and a <emph render="doublequote">Keep Well</emph>
            campaign). Other advertisements were backed by Lambert Pharmacal Co. (women's
            employment); Libbey Glass Company (recruitment of women Marines and nurses' aides);
            National Retail Dry Goods Association (nurse recruitment); Owens Illinois-Glass Company
            (paper salvage); Petroleum Industry War Council (campaigns for saving tires, rubber, and
            gasoline); Shell Oil Company and other petroleum and rubber companies (salvage of scarce
            materials); and Textron (nurse recruitment).</p>
         <p>Related materials may be found elsewhere in the J. Walter Thompson Co. Archives,
            including the papers of JWT executives such as Samuel W. Meek, Walter O'Meara, Helen
            Lansdowne Resor, Stanley Burnet Resor, Ruth F. Waldo and James Webb Young. Similar
            materials may also be found in the R.C. Maxwell Company Outdoor Advertising Archives;
            the War Effort Mobilization Campaigns Poster Collection; and the Outdoor Advertising
            Association of America (OAAA) Archives.</p>
