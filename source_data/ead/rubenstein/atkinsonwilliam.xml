         <abstract id="aspace_7cff2a6c5b6ae1770e93b0e7d0b457ea">William Atkinson was baptized on
            March 8, 1679. He appears to have been an amateur theologian or preacher in Great
            Britain. The collection consists of a handmade, leather-bound notebook that possibly
            belonged to William Atkinson. Compact handwriting fills all 96 pages plus the inside
            front and back covers with extracts taken from the works of contemporary theologians
            including John Tillotson's sermons, William Nichols's Defence of the Doctrine and
            Discipline of the Church of England, and Richard Baxter's Now or Never; along with
            Atkinson's commentary on the extracts and potentially original theological reflections
            or sermons by him. The choice of extracts, the inclusion of entries on Quaker theology,
            and the nature of Atkinson's criticism suggest that he took a non-conformist stance
            against the Church of England. The notebook is undated, but refers to the year 1715 on
            page four.</abstract>

            theologian or preacher whose stance was not in conformity with the Church of England. He
