      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection comprises an handmade account book with paper covers (35 pages, some blank, with
        an additional 5 leaves excised) maintained by Susan P. Parrott from 1839-1846, mainly to
        track her payments to at least 30 women she hired to work for her from one day to several
        months at a time. It is not clear in what capacity she hired the women, although one, Martha
        Brackett, was a seamstress. A few entries are accompanied by notes on the women: Martha
        White was African American, and on 1842 July 1, Parrott noted that she engaged Bridget(t)
        O'Boyle "to stay two months from this date--and to behave herself better." Other payments
        were recorded for tobacco, cider, gin, pills, medicine, bonnets, dresses, corsets, slippers,
        ribbons and a lace collar, cloth, gloves, crockery, and letters. Parrott also recorded cash
        entries.</p>
