      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection comprises a contract, dated 1865 June 8, made with 28 male and female former
        slaves for the growing of cotton on the "Plains" plantation in Fayette, Jefferson County,
        Mississippi. The laborers committed to working every day "from sun to sun," except Sunday,
        with other possible days off. They were to be paid one quarter of the net proceeds for the
        crop. The contract was witnessed by O.H. McGinty[?] and signed by executors E.G. Woods and
        Stephen Ireland; the last name of the deceased owner is illegible. Surnames of the freedmen
        include: Wilson, Thompson, Digg, Turner, Lonsway, Hatton, Clement, Willis, Payne, West,
        Blair, Garner, Kelley, Arran, and Johnson. The laborers range in age from 17 to 68. Fifteen
        children living on the plantation are listed as dependents on the back of the contract. The
        document was recorded by the sub-commissioner for the Freedmen's Department in Jefferson
        County, A.M. Brobst[?], on 1865 August 28, with notes regarding the executors, the
        contract's attachment to a lien, and $45 taxes paid on 15 laborers on August 21. The
        contract was completed using iron gall ink; there is some associated corrosion of the paper.
        Acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin Research Center for African and African American
        History and Culture.</p>
