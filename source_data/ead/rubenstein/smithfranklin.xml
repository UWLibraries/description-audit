         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection is chiefly made up of correspondence, containing much information on
            Smith's family, his career and journeys as a sea captain, and the Civil War period. The
            earlier material in the collection consists of letters from Smith to his parents and to
            his first wife, Elizabeth, and concerns Smith's voyages on the trading vessel Eutaw,
            carrying coffee and cotton between Delaware and Calcutta, India; his transfer to the
            brig Mary in 1831, his connection with the shipping firm of Grinnell, Minturn and
            Company; and the wrecking of the ship Sampson in 1841. </p>
         <p>For the period 1838 to 1846 the correspondence relates to Smith's second marriage, 1838,
            to Mary Caroline Trainer of Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, and his settling on a farm with
            his wife and daughters, Sarah and Hannah. For the period 1846-1852 the collection
            concerns Smith's return to the sea on the brig Osceola; his service in the Mexican War;
            the wrecking of his ship Vera Cruz, owned by the firm Burling and Dixon; a voyage around
            Cape Horn, 1851; a trip to San Francisco, 1851-1852; and his sailing the Messenger for
