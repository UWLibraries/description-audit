            notebooks, financial papers, legal papers, genealogical documents, printed materials,
            and other materials pertain to the Knight family of Natchez, Mississippi and Frederick,
            Maryland. Materials in the collection date from 1784 to 1960, and the bulk date from the
            1840s to the 1890s. The majority of the papers concern the personal, legal, and
            financial activities of John Knight (1806-1864), merchant, plantation owner, and
            investor; his wife Frances Z. S. (Beall) Knight (1813-1900); and their daughter Frances
            (Fanny) Beall Knight; as well as relatives, friends, and business partners, especially
            banker Enoch Pratt and William M. Beall. Significant topics include: life in Natchez,
            Mississippi and Frederick, Maryland; plantations, slaves, and slavery in Mississippi and
            other Southern states; 19th century economic conditions, especially concerning cotton,
            banking and bank failures; U.S. politics in the 1850s-1860s; the Civil War, especially
            in Maryland; cholera and yellow fever outbreaks; 19th century family life; and the
            family's travels to Europe, Russia, and other places from 1850 to 1864. Genealogies
            chiefly relate to the descendants of Elisha Beall of Maryland, and the McCleery, Pettit,
            and McLanahan families of Indiana and Maryland.</abstract>

         <p>Collection contains correspondence, diaries and notebooks, financial papers, legal
            papers, genealogical documents, printed materials, and other items pertaining to the
            Knight family of Natchez, Mississippi and Frederick, Maryland. Materials in the
            collection date from 1784 to 1960, with the bulk of the papers dating from the 1840s to
            the 1890s. The majority concern the personal, legal, and financial activities of John
            Knight (1806-1864), merchant, plantation owner, lawyer, and investor; Frances Z. S.
            (Beall) Knight (1813-1900), his wife; and their daughter Frances (Fanny) Beall Knight;
            as well as relatives, friends, and business partners, especially banker Enoch Pratt and
            William Beall. </p>
         <p>Significant topics include: life in Natchez, Mississippi and Frederick, Maryland;
            plantations, slaves, and slavery in Mississippi and other Southern states; 19th century
            economic conditions, especially concerning the cotton market; banking and bank failures;
            U.S. politics in the 1850s and 1860s; the Civil War, especially in Maryland; reports of
            cholera and yellow fever outbreaks; 19th century family life; and the Knights' travels
            to Europe, Egypt, Turkey, and Russia from 1850 to 1864. </p>
         <p>Genealogies chiefly relate to the descendants of Elisha Beall of Maryland. There are
            also two late 19th century albumen photographs of homes in West Virginia (James and
            Lizzie Brown's "Kingswood") and Maryland ("Beallview," the house of Elisha Beall). A few
            other images of the Knights are found in the Rubenstein Library's Picture File
            Collection.</p>
         <p>The papers of John Knight concern his business relations with the Beall family of
            Maryland; his plantations in Mississippi, Hyde Park and Beverly Place, and their
            management; the purchases, expenses, and medical care of the enslaved people who lived
            and worked on those plantations; investments in cotton land in Mississippi, Louisiana,
            and Arkansas; economic conditions in the United States, especially concerning the cotton
            market; the effects of the Civil War, especially in Maryland; and the family's trips to
            Europe. His notebooks keep careful track of expenses and income, as well as travel. The
            many land deeds, indentures, slave lists, bills of purchase, and other financial and
            legal documents in the collection, some dating to the 1700s, chiefly relate to his
            activities as an attorney and landholder. Many also relate to the legal and financial
            activities of the Beall family, particularly to William M. Beall. John Knight was also
            interested in medicine, so the collection holds memoranda books and other papers with
            prescriptions, receipts, and instructions for medicines treating ailments of the
            time.</p>
         <p>Papers of his wife, Frances (Beall) Knight, include 21 diaries and some correspondence,
            as well as financial and legal papers. Her diaries describe in detail life in Natchez,
            Mississippi, religious life, family members, visits, the weather, and health. Of
            particular interest are her travel diaries, which document the family's travels to
            Europe, with side trips to Egypt, Turkey, Russia, and other places. Her later papers
            deal with her financial activities as a relatively young widow, and her role as guardian
            of her two grandchildren, Knight and Alexandra McDannold, who lived with her after the
            early deaths of their parents, Fanny Knight McDannold and Thomas McDannold. </p>
         <p>The ten diaries of Frances (Fanny) Beall Knight, the daughter of John and Frances
            Knight, document in some detail their trips to Europe, and details of her father's death
            abroad in 1864; the collection also contains some of her school and family notebooks and
            correspondence. Later papers refer to her husband, Thomas Alexander McDannold, who may
            have been the author of at least one of the anonymous notebooks in the collection, and
            their two children, Alexandra and John.</p>
         <p>20th century dates in the collection refer to a typed draft of a paper on 19th century
            packet ships, and an article from a Maryland history magazine.</p>

         <p>John M. Knight was born in 1806 in Maryland. He was primarily a merchant and financier,
            but he also owned lands in Louisiana, Arkansas, and several plantations in Mississippi.
            His financial investments and legal activities were chiefly handled by his business
            partners William M. Beall and Enoch Pratt, both of Maryland. He was ill for much of his
            life, but managed to travel abroad extensively with his family from the 1840s through
            the 1860s. He died in Biarritz, France, in 1864 and was buried in Maryland.</p>
         <p>John Knight's wife, Frances Zeruiah Susannah Beall, was his first cousin through the
            Beall family. She was born in 1813 and died in 1900, outliving her husband by many
            years, and handling his estate and the guardianship of her two young grandchildren after
            the early deaths of their parents, Frances (Fanny) Knight and Thomas Alexander
            McDannold.</p>
         <p>Additional information on the Beall and Knight family histories can be found in the
            Genealogy series in this collection and online.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Correspondence consists chiefly of business letters by John Knight and his
                  partners and friends. However, there are also many letters by Knight family
                  members and their relatives and friends. The correspondence begins in 1817 with
                  letters from Mary (McCleery) Knight in Indiana to her sister Frances (McCleery)
                  Beall, William M. Beall's wife. There is also correspondence between Fanny Knight,
                  John and Frances Knight's daughter, and Thomas McDannold during their courtship.
                  Correspondence also includes letters from friends and relatives while the Knights
                  were traveling abroad. Many letters also mention John Knight's attempts at various
                  cures for ill health, including water cures, hot springs, and baths.</p>
               <p>Between 1830 and 1864, Knight's business correspondence with Enoch Pratt, a
                  Baltimore banker in charge of Knight's finances, William Beall, and others,
                  predominates. Topics include: the U.S. political and economic climate: the
                  conflict between Henry Clay and Andrew Jackson; the cotton market; banking and
                  bank failures; investment in cotton land in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas;
                  the purchase and sale of slaves, with some bought by William Beall and sent to
                  Knight in Mississippi; the treatment and medical care of slaves; the operation of
                  Knight's plantations; piracy on the Mississippi River, 1841; cholera and yellow
                  fever epidemics in New York and New Orleans in 1832, 1833, 1837, and 1841; the
                  economic panic of 1857; education at the Frederick Female Academy, Frederick,
                  Maryland; financial conditions in the United States during the Civil War; the
                  relations between the United States and England during the war; and the course of
                  the Civil War, especially the Union invasion of Maryland. One early letter from
                  Roger Brooke Taney to William Murdock Beall explains his refusal of the
                  vice-presidency and discussing his interest in the U.S. presidency.</p>
               <p>Other smaller groups of correspondence were written by Frances "Fanny" Knight
                  McDannold, the daughter of John and Frances Knight, her children Knight and
                  Alexandra, and husband Thomas McDannold, and that family's acquaintances.</p>
               <p>The correspondence ends with a much smaller series of letters, which include items
                  to Frances S.Z. Knight from her grandchildren, and other correspondence reflecting
                  her financial and legal activities as she managed her husband's large estate and
                  the guardianship of her grandchildren even as she approached old age. </p>
               <p>Some additional correspondence can be found in the Legal and Financial Papers
                  series.</p>

               <p>Series consists of diaries and notebooks, almost all written by Frances Beall
                  Knight (21), with some by John Knight (4), and Fanny Knight (10)). Most are small
                  bound volumes, but a few are larger in size.</p>
               <p>The Frances Beall Knight diaries span the years 1845-1865; and an anomyous 1892
                  diary has also been identified as hers. Other anonymous volumes in the collection
                  have not been identified but may also be hers. The earliest diaries describe in
                  detail of life in Natchez, Mississippi, chiefly commenting on the weather,
                  illnesses, visits, and other aspects of daily routine; there are also many
                  passages concerning religion and religious activities, as well as comments on the
                  Mexican War, guncotton, the use of electrictiy, and the telegraph. A large group
                  of the volumes relates to several visits made by the Knight family to Europe,
                  chiefly to cities and resorts in France, Switzerland, and Italy, between 1850 and
                  1864, as well as a visit to Egypt, Turkey, and Russia. In the last volume, from
                  1892, an elderly Frances Beall Knight describes life with her grandchildren, who
                  were at that time also her wards. </p>
               <p>The Frances (Fanny) Beall Knight diaries, written by the young daughter of John
                  and Frances Knight from 1852 to 1864, also describe daily life and travels in
                  Europe, although in less detail; in 1864, Fanny describes the circumstances of her
                  father's death in Biarritz, France.</p>
               <p>The notebooks and diaries of John Knight from 1850 to 1856 contain financial
                  notes, hotel lists, and travel expenses. </p>
               <p>This series houses six anonymous diaries, dating from 1867 to 1883, which are
                  likely by Knight family members, some possibly by Fannie's husband Thomas A.
                  McDannold (1835-1883).</p>

               <p>A variety of small volumes kept by family members make up this series. Frances
                  Beall Knight's 1831-1879 notebooks include a scrapbook with a few entries from her
                  husband and friends, pasted-in clippings with obituaries for Elisha Beall, William
                  M. Beall, and Zeruiah Bell, pasted-in engravings, copied poems, and other
                  writings. There is also a notebook with medical and financial content; a notebook
                  with mostly religious content; and a notebook on various subjects. </p>
               <p>There is one notebook from 1858 identified as John Knight's, in which he describes
                  the family's trip to Russia. Also in the series are Frances (Fanny) Beall Knight's
                  booklets of schoolwork dated from the 1840s to 1854. </p>
               <p>This series also includes four anonymous notebooks. The smallest item, from after
                  1862, is actually a small folded sheaf of notes on world history, perhaps from a
                  lecture or a book. Another small volume, circa 1864, contains needlework patterns,
                  recipes, and housekeeping notes, and may be Fanny Knight's; a notebook from 1884
                  listing traveling trunk and bank vault contents, and medical receipts, which may
                  be Frances B. Knight's while she acted as guardian of her two grandchildren; and
                  another is a baby journal recording in detail the first years of Knight
                  McDannold's life, 1875-1882.</p>

                  pertain to plantation expenses, slaveholding and related activities. Additional

               <p>Two albumen photographs on large card mounts, showing views of two ancestral
                  homes. Also found in the Rubenstein Library's Picture Collection, probably
                  separated from the Knight collection: a copy of a miniature of John Knight painted
                  by Hugh Bridgeport in 1832; a photograph of Frances Z.S. Beall Knight; and
                  photographs of Knight and of his tombstone in Mount Olivet Cemetery, Frederick,
                  Maryland.</p>
