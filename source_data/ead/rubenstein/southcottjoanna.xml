      <p>Joanna Southcott (1750-1814) was raised in Gittisham, Devon, England in a devout family. In
        1792 Southcott became convinced that she possessed supernatural gifts and was receiving
        revelation. She was invited to London and began selling paper Seals of the Lord, said to
        guarantee the purchaser’s place among the 144,000 allowed into Heaven. At the age of 64,
        Southcott announced she would give birth to a divine child named Shiloh in October 1814.
        Southcott died not long after, followers claim in childbirth. Her followers, referred to as
        Southcottians, are said to have numbered over 100,000 but declined greatly by the end of the
        nineteenth century. Southcott left a sealed wooden box of prophecies with the instruction
        that it be opened only at a time of national crisis, and then only in the presence of all 24
        bishops of the Church of England. An advertising campaign on billboards and in Britsh
        national newpapers ran in the 1960s and 1970s by one prominent group of Southcottians - the
        Panacea Society - tried to persuade the 24 bishops to have the box opened. The location and
        contents of the box are still debated today. Southcott's publications number over 60.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Printed petition to “The Lords Spiritual and Temporal and to The Gentlemen of the House of
        Commons.” The petition contains claims to prophecy and a plea for the release of Mr.
        Brothers. Richard Brothers was a fellow proclaimed prophet who was arrested and eventually
        confined for insanity. Southcott mentions that she is selling prophecies at E.I. Field’s,
        No. 3, Broad-Court, Long-Acre, London. Collection also includes a paper wrapping most likely
        used for the petition addressed to Michael Hecks Beach, MP, Member for Cirencester. The
        wrapper is annotated “Gone away not known where. Residents not known at the House of
        Commons.” The inside of the wrapper contains a statement of support for Southcott’s claims
        to prophecy signed by several men and dated May 29, 1802. In addition, there is a printed
        flyer titled “Remarkable fulfilment of the Southcott prophecies from 1792 to the present
        day.” Fourth and revised edition from June 1931. The flyer speaks of the box of prophecies
        left by Southcott and what will result from reading them; also outlines some of Southcott’s
        prophecies.</p>
