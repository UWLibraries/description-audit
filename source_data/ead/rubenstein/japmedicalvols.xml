            in this collection range from 10 to 154 pages, and were created in Japan from about 1810
            to 1849, chiefly by medical students. The notebooks usually take one of two forms:
            transcriptions of lectures and demonstrations, and bodies of knowledge written up as
            manuals by well-known Japanese physicians of the time, especially Hanaoka Seishū and
            Takenaka Bunpō. Topics covered include herbal medicines and other prescriptions;
            treatments for diseases of the eyes and other parts of the head; surgery, particularly
            for cancers, tumors, and fistulas; breast cancer; smallpox; scurvy; osteopathy;
            treatment of wounds; suturing; hematology; gynecology and obstetrics; and pediatric
            medicine. Some notebooks contain black-and-white and color hand-drawn illustrations -
            many full-page - of surgeries, close-ups of suturing, bandages and wrappings,
            osteopathic manipulations, and medicinal plants. In most cases, the author or copyist
            recorded details such the place and time of the lecture and the name of the medical
            school. There are references in the notes to at least a dozen other contemporary or
            earlier physicians, and to earlier dates for the work being copied - these range from
            1677 to 1796. Acquired as part of the History of Medicine Collections at Duke

         <head>Historical and Biographical Note</head>
         <p>At the time when these volumes were written in the first quarter of the 19th century,
            Japanese medical practice was quite advanced due to a melding of Chinese, Portuguese,
            and Dutch medical practices, and the pioneering advances of Japanese physicians. By the
            early 1800s there were a number of medical schools in Japan, two of which are mentioned
            in the notebooks: Shunrinken (春 林 軒), Hanaoka Seishū's medical school located in
            Wakayama prefecture; and Seibidō (済 美 堂), located in Kyōto, led by Takenaka Bunpō. Some
            of the early medical schools such as Shunrinken graduated hundreds of medical students
            within a short period. Copying lecture notes and materia medica was part of the learning
            process, and resulted in a kind of manuscript medical manual that was then used for
            further studies or copied and passed down to other students. Several of the notebooks in
            this collection refer to bodies of knowledge originally authored by Hanaoka Seishū and
            Takenaka Bunpō.</p>
         <p>Hanaoka Seishū (華 岡 青 洲) (1760-1835) was most known for his study and teaching of herbal
            medicine, surgical techniques, and the treatment of cancers, fistulas, and other serious
            ailments; he was also well-known for his pioneering use of general anesthesia long
            before it was first attempted by Western physicians. He advocated for the adoption of
            Western medicine as practiced by Dutch physicians, allying it with traditional Japanese
            Kampo medicine, which focused on herbal and mineral preparations.</p>
         <p>Takenaka Bunpō (竹 中 文 輔) (1766-1836), also known as Takenaka Bisai and Takenaka Nanpō,
            studied in Kyoto under Wada Tōkaku and specialized in surgical techniques and smallpox
            treatments. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The sixty-three Japanese manuscript volumes in this collection were created from 1810 to
            1849, chiefly by medical students, and document Japanese medical training and practice
            during the time also known as the Edo period, and the conjoining of Chinese-inspired
               <emph render="italic">materia medica</emph> with current Western medical practices
            introduced primarily by the Dutch. The notebooks range in length from 10 to 154 pages,
            and typically take the form of transcriptions of lectures and demonstrations; in many
            cases the writer recorded the place and time of the demonstration and the name of the
            medical school. There are also volumes which represent the collected knowledge of
            well-known Japanese physicians of the time, especially Hanaoka Seishū but also Takenaka
            Bunsuke (Nanpō). There are references in the notes to at least a dozen other
            contemporary or earlier physicians.</p>
         <p>The copyists and note-takers signed their names at the end of the volumes; the name
            Yamanaka Shūsai Hideyuki appears most frequently; also appearing frequently are the
            names of editors and proofreaders, and corrections and later annotations in red ink are
            found in a number of the manuscripts. In addition to the contemporary dates, there are
            many references to the earlier manuscript versions being copied: these dates range from
            1677 to 1796.</p>
         <p>The topics covered by the volumes range widely, and include: herbal medicine and other
            prescriptions; treatments for diseases of the eye and other parts of the head; surgery,
            particularly on cancers, swellings, and fistulas; breast cancer; smallpox; scurvy;
            osteopathy; the treatment of wounds; hematology; gynecology and obstetrics; and
            pediatric medicine. There are several volumes containing illustrative drawings, some
            hand-colored and others are black-and-white; they include detailed images of surgical
            procedures and close-ups of suturing; examples of bandages and wrappings; osteopathic
            manipulations; and medicinal plants.</p>
         <p>One volume in particular stands out above the rest, consisting of over ninety carefully
            drawn, full-page, hand-coloured illustrations, nine of which are double-page, displaying
            patients with dislocated limbs, skin cancer, or requiring sophisticated bandages, as
            well as illustrations of internal organs and one page with surgical instruments. One of
            the illustrations is a realistic portrait of Hanaoka Seishū, with a beard and spectacles
            (probably imported from Holland), showing him excising a cyst from a patient. At the end
            of the volume, two different explanatory texts in Kanbun (classical Chinese read in the
            Japanese manner) provide comments in the volume about the diseases and their
            treatment.</p>
         <p>Each codex in the collection is composed of leaves of rice paper, with hand-sewn
            bindings and soft covers, and calligraphy in black and red ink. Some of the texts are
            written in Shino Japanese (Chinese reading style) using all Kanji characters, while
            other texts are in Shino Japanese written in 19th-century characters - the language of
            the educated class in Japan. At least one volume (Vol. 21) contains Dutch words for
            medicinal compounds. The script reads back to front; the script is laid out in vertical
            columns that are read from right to left across the page. In some cases, pages or
            sections and covers are missing, and some volumes bear traces of insect damage, but for
            the most part, the volumes are remarkably well-preserved.</p>
         <p>All titles are taken when possible from the covers or from section headings; approximate
            translations in English provided by library staff and are in brackets. In the case of
            missing titles, a title was supplied from content by library staff. Titles and
            significant names are also given in Japanese characters, and some older calendar dates
            are also given in modern Western dates. Illegible or untranslatable text is indicated by
            blank lines.</p>
         <p>Volumes are arranged in this collection guide in two series: sets of notebooks, and
            single volumes. The items in the sets are linked by common themes or bodies of
            knowledge, and range from two to eleven volumes. They include collections of works by
            one physician, as well as sets of manuals and lecture notes on topics such as obstetrics
            and gynecology, metallurgy, opthalmology, pox and skin diseases, and others. Single
            volumes are housed after the sets.</p>

                  <p>This set of five notebooks is a copy of one of Dr. Futei Fukui's most famous
                     works, a guide to medicinal compounds containing herbs and minerals for various

                     The name Seibidō refers to a medical practice in Kyoto of physician Takenaka

                     is a copy of an original medical manual by Takenaka Bunpō, copied by Yamanaka
                     Hideyuki, probably a medical student at Seibidō.</p>

                  <p>The notebook is profusely illustrated with hand-colored drawings of osteopathic
                     manipulations, cotton dressing materials, and bandages applied to different

                  <p> Shunrinken (春林軒) is the name of Dr. Seishu's medical school. Kasho means
                     "family book," which refers to the intellectual legacy of the "family" Hana ke
                     (華家) (a shortened form of Hanaoka, the famous physician). The date is probably
                     incorrectly written, because Tsuchinoto Mi is the second year of Kōka era
                     rather than the Bunsei era [1845]. It is more likely the year Tsuchinoe Ne
                     [1828] in the Bunsei era.</p>

                     techniques with illustrations, gunshot wounds, hemostatic method and treatment

                     the page was used for notes, a few of which include small illustrations of
                     suturing. On the last page: "This lecture was copied at Dr. Seishū's new school

                  <p> Katakura Genshū (1751-1822) used the name Shinpo in formal situations. He also
                     used the name Kakuryō 鶴陵 as his nickname. He was a medical practitioner in the
                     late Edo period who introduced the use of western obstetrical forceps.</p>

                  <p>One of the longest notebooks at 154 pages, covering 56 illnesses and their
                     symptoms, treatments, and medicinal herbs. There are dried leaves laid into the
                     folds of pages 60 and 94. In the last page an explanation reads: "Shiken hō is
                     said to be written by Kyōto's Doctor Fukui. This book is of Kashū Kanazawa
                     Yoshioka Jōhei's [Ishikawa prefecture, Kanazawa, Yoshioka Johei] in which the
                     illnesses are arranged by categories, then treatment methods are listed under
                     each illnesses so it will be useful for searching. Thus it is not the same book
                     as Fukui's original book. But since we couldn't find any better one, I copied
                     this one here." "Bunsei 12 [1829] Jan. at Shunrinken new school by Sen
