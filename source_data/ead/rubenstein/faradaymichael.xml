            letters written by Michael Faraday, English physicist and resident of the Royal
            Institution of Great Britain, toward the end of his life. One is addressed to the
            Duchess of Northumberland thanking her for her generosity, and asking if she might send
            Faraday something in return, apparently a photograph of herself. The other letter is
            written to F. Gye, also thanking him for a gift, most likely tickets to a Covent Garden
            show: Frederick Gye was the prominent manager for the Royal Italian Opera productions.
