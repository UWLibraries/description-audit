        of two pieces of correspondence written by the author to an editor, Mr. Sawyer, and to Lucy
        Coffin. Sarah Orne Jewett was a well-known 19th century author whose fiction is set in her
        native rural Maine. In the first letter, Jewett declines to send Mr. Sawyer anything to
        print in the first issue of his magazine, as she has been ill and busy, and doesn't want to
        write something in a hurry, although she wishes him well with his new publication. The
        second is a condolence letter to Lucy Coffin of Newbury, Massachusetts on the loss of her
        father. The Coffins were a prominent Massachusetts family.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Sarah Orne Jewett was a 19th century American writer who published novels, short stories,
        and poetry. Her writing chronicled life in her native rural Maine and featured strong female
        characters. Beginning in 1881, Jewett lived with her friend and companion Annie Adams
        Fields, the widow of James Thomas Fields, who had been the editor of the Atlantic Monthly.
        Jewett's best-known work is her short story collection "The Country of the Pointed Firs,"
        (1896) which has been cited as an influence on Elizabeth Strout's Pulizer prize-winning
        "Olive Kitteridge."</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection consists of two autograph manuscript letters written by Sarah Orne Jewett. The
        first is addressed to a Mr. Sawyer, the editor of a new journal, declining to send him
        anything to print in his first issue, as she has been ill and doesn't wish to write
        something in a hurry. She sends him "hearty good wishes for the success of his magazine,"
        asks him to send her a prospectus, and "suppose[s] that, like all editors, you have more
        verses than you wish to print." The letter is on a single sheet of folded paper with writing
        on three pages dated 1877 June 15 and written from South Berwick, [Maine]. The second letter
        is a sympathy note written on mourning stationery and addressed to Miss [Lucy] Coffin dated
        26 December, but lacking a year. A Boston address appears at the top. Jewett expresses
        sympathy for the loss of Miss Coffin's father from both her and her companion Mrs. Field,
        and reminisces about a day they had spent together in Newburyport. Jewett references John
        Greenleaf Whittier, who was a student of Lucy's cousin Joseph while at Dartmouth College.
        The Coffin Family was prominent in New England and lived in Newbury, Massachusetts for many
        generations.</p>
