        34 nitrate sheet negatives features black-and-white travel images taken mainly in European
        cities. Subjects chiefly focus on popular tourist landmarks such as gardens, parks, bridges,
        buildings, and statuary. The travelers seem to be all women and at least one young child.
        Locations identified by library staff include Paris and Bruges, but other locations are
        unidentified, as are the photographer and subjects. It is assumed that some locations are in
        London or England, as one of two commercial photograph processing envelopes from the London
        firm Selfridge's accompanying the negatives is marked "English trip 1913." The negatives are
        sized 3 5/8 x 4 7/8 inches.</abstract>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This early 20th century collection of 34 nitrate sheet negatives features black-and-white
        tourist travel images mainly taken in European cities sometime between 1910-1915. Subjects
        chiefly focus on landmarks such as gardens, parks, bridges, buildings, and statuary. The
        travelers seem to include women and at least one young child. Identified cities include
        Paris and Bruges, but other locations are uncertain, as are the identities of the
        photographer and subjects. Two commercial photographic processing envelopes are from the
        London firm Selfridge's; one is marked "English trip, 1913." The negatives are sized 3 5/8 x
        4 7/8 inches. </p>
      <p>The dating is taken in part from the 1913 date on the processing envelope and from a
        billboard advertising a musical being staged in Paris.</p>
      <p>Forms part of the Lisa Unger Baskin Collection, acquired as part of the Sallie Bingham
        Center for Women's History and Culture.</p>
