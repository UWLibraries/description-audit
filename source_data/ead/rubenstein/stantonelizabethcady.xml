      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815 November 12-1902 October 26) was an American suffragist,
        social activist, abolitionist, and leading figure of the early women's rights movement. Her
        Declaration of Sentiments, presented at the Seneca Falls Convention held in 1848 in Seneca
        Falls, New York, is often credited with initiating the first organized women's rights and
        women's suffrage movements in the United States. Stanton was president of the National Woman
        Suffrage Association from 1892 until 1900.</p>
