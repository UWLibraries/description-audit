            papers of the Gregory family and the related Pomfret, Beasley, Davis, Smith families of
            King William County, Va. and later of Granville County, N.C. Correspondence of the 18th
            century is largely that of Sally Pomfret Beasley with friends (mostly suitors) and
            relatives prior to her marriage to Stephen Beasley in 1786. From 1786-1830 the
            correspondence is with relatives of the Smith and Beasley families who are living in
            North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Ohio. There is a gap in the papers from
            1830-1859. After 1859, the papers are largely those of William H. (Buck) Gregory while
            at the University of Virginia (1859-60), in the Confederate Army (1864-65), and in the
            merchantile and publishing business in Oxford and Stovall, NC in the 1870's and 1880's.
            This correspondence contains information on tobacco culture, social life and customs,
            amusements, and education in North Carolina. In 1888 he married Mary J. Davis, and there
            is much correspondence of their courtship. Collection includes lists of students at
            Belmont Academy, 1859, in Granville County and at the Oxford Classical and Grammar
            School, 1859-60,as well as genealogical information on the Pomfret, Gregory, Smith and
            Alexander families. Also includes diaries for various years between 1873 and
            1903.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection consists of papers, principally those of William H. (Buck) Gregory,
            Stovall, North Carolina, while at the University of Virginia, 1859-60, in the
            Confederate service, 1865-65, and in the mercantile and publishing businesses in Oxford
            during the 1870s and 1880s. In 1888 he married Mary J. Davis of "Abram's Plains",
            Granville County, a descendant of Col. Sam. Smith, and there is much of the
            correspondence that was carried on while they were courting. The collection contains
            some information on tobacco culture, social life and customs, amusements, education
            (There are lists of students at Belmont Academy, 1859, in Granville County and at the
            Oxford Classical and Grammar School, 1859-60.), and a considerable amount of
            genealogical data on the Davis, Pomfret, Gregory, Smith, Downey, Alexander, Webb, and
            Winston families. </p>
         <p>The Civil War letters are centered around W. H. Gregory and his service to the
            Confederacy. He was sixteen at the beginning of the war and suffered a physical
            disability which kept him in reserve units. Letters concern the Granville Greys, Co. K
            of the 23rd N. C Troops, later the 1st Jr. Reserve (Co. B 70th Regt. Jr. Res.). Dr. T.
            R. Gregory is in a Yankee prison, and other Gregory relatives write war letters. C. W.
            Broadfcot, Hugh Lawson Clay, Theophilus Holmes, Joseph Jonathan Davis, Walter Clark,
            Allen R. Boyd, and Wm. G. Stanard are among the correspondents. </p>
         <p>The bound volumes, include a 9 volume diary by William H. Gregory for the years 1873,
            1888, 1889, 1891, 1895, 1895, 1898, 1902, and 1903. The contents of these volumes,
            however, are very meager. See the Samuel Smith Downey Papers to which about 62 items of
            early Smith-Downey family MSS. were transferred, 8-24-65, from the W. H. Gregory
            MSS.</p>
