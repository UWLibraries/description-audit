                     father of Victor Hugo. The header features a French Republic crest between two
                     words: Liberté and Egalité. This is a handwritten note in black ink on
                     letterhead from the 1st Permanent War Council of the 17th Military Division for
                     the French Government. Written during the French Revolution, the document is
                     dated as 26 Messidor, l'an 6 (July 14th, 1798).</p>

                  <p>This form letter from the "Xe Armée État-Major 2e Buereau' on behalf of the
                     President of the Triage Commission. Composed just after the end of the First
                     World War, the letter details the conditions for release of a German prisoner
                     (the name of the German soldier appears to be Joseph Molimann). In bold script
                     there are instructions for the German soldier to immediately leave the German
                     army, or he will face the French Military Authorities.</p>
