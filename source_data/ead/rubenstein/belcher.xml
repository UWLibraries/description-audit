         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Max Belcher was born in Philadelphia in 1944 to an African American father from North
            Carolina and a Jewish American mother of Polish/Lithuanian descent, born in rural
            Pennsylvania. In 1952 his father went to the Gold Coast at the invitation of the
            couple's wartime friend, Kwame Nkrumah, for what was meant to be an eight-week business
            trip. His father was to remain in Africa for the next four decades. By 1954, Belcher,
            Sr. had established himself in neighboring Liberia and had become a naturalized Liberian
            citizen; Max and his mother and sister then joined him. </p>
         <p>At sixteen, Max Belcher began working in broadcasting as a staff announcer for the
            Liberian Broadcasting Corporation. By the time he left to go to school in the U.S. in
            1964, his lived experience in Liberia, French Guinea and Sierra Leone, combined with his
            growing appreciation of the capacity of radio, television and film to inform and
            influence, made him aware of the need for the material and techniques required to
            disseminate practical information in a developing country, particularly on matters of
            public health, agricultural practice, child rearing, and road safety.</p>
         <p>Belcher's plans were quickly thwarted by the escalation of the Vietnam War. Feeling that
            the draft was inevitable, Belcher enlisted in the U.S. Marines, serving as a radio and
            television broadcaster in the U.S. and at Armed Forces Radio and Television Service on
            Okinawa; and as a Marine Corps Combat Correspondent in Vietnam. After his tour of duty
            he settled in New York City, where he took a full-time job as a production assistant at
            NBC News and enrolled in college. He began his studies at Columbia University in 1968
            but quickly transferred to the New School for Social Research, where a filmmaking
            instructor encouraged him to grow accustomed to seeing the world through the lens of a
            still camera. That training, initially intended to develop his skills as a filmmaker,
            introduced Belcher to the expressive potential of photography. </p>
         <p>Continuing his liberal arts studies at the New School, he also enrolled in a photography
            class at the School of Visual Arts. At the same time he began shooting experimental
            photographs in and around New York City, often choosing friends, landscapes and local
            architecture as his subjects. Finishing his studies in 1970, he returned to Liberia in
            1971, embarking on what would become his first major project as a professional
            photographer.</p>
         <p>Since that time, Belcher's photographic interests in portraiture and vernacular
            architecture have developed in conjunction with the thematic exploration of racial
            identity, emigration and history that run through his work in Africa, Asia, North
            America, the Middle East, and the Caribbean. He has had numerous one-man shows in the
            eastern United States and has contributed to group exhibits group exhibits across the
            U.S. and in Canada, Italy, Chile, Vietnam, and Soviet Armenia. Belcher's photography is
            held both by private collectors and in the permanent collections of galleries and
            museums in the United States, Canada, and Vietnam. He has received major support from
            the National Endowment for the Humanities, Fulbright Scholars Program, the LEF
            Foundation, Massachusetts Cultural Council, the Kenan Charitable Trust, and programs of
            the National Endowment for the Arts. His publications include <title type="simple"
               render="italic">House and Home: Spirits of the South</title> (1994), and <title
               type="simple" render="italic">A Land and Life Remembered: Americo-Liberian Folk
               Architecture</title> (1988), both held by the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp;
            Manuscript Library. He has also taught black-and-white photography to beginning,
            intermediate and advanced students in Massachusetts, and has lectured on his work. He
            currently resides in Cambridge, Massachusetts with his wife.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The photographs and printed materials in this collection date from 1969 to 1998, and
            document the work of Max Belcher, American-born photographer. The collection is
            organized into two series: <emph render="bold">Printed Materials</emph> and <emph
               render="bold">Photography.</emph> The <emph render="bold">Printed Materials
               Series</emph> consists of publicity, exhibit literature, and other materials related
            to Belcher's work as a photographer. The much larger <emph render="bold">Photography
               Series</emph> includes 1,027 contact sheets (860 black-and-white, 167 color), 381
            photographs (239 black-and-white, 142 color), and five color fine prints spanning nearly
            three decades of Belcher's professional work as a photographer. This series is divided
            into eleven project-based subseries, which have been arranged chronologically by the
            start date of each project. Within each subseries, contact sheets precede
            photographs,and black-and-white work precedes color. Individual items in the photography
            series bear specific technical and identifying information, usually marked by Belcher on
            the backs of contact sheets and photographs. Acquired as part of the Archive of
            Documentary Arts.</p>

               <p>The photography in this collection represents Belcher's work from his first forays
                  into photography in New York City between <unitdate era="ce" calendar="gregorian"
                     type="inclusive">1969</unitdate> and <unitdate era="ce" calendar="gregorian"
                     type="inclusive">1971</unitdate>, up to his most recent projects in Vietnam,
                  the Dominican Republic and the United States. This series is organized by project
                  subseries, which are arranged chronologically by the beginning date of each
                  project. Within each subseries, black-and-white work precedes color work, and
                  contact sheets precede photographs. Subseries descriptions describing collection
                  holdings for each project follow the restrictions note below. For information
                  about specific contact sheets and photographs, researchers are advised to consult
                  Belcher's own notes on his work, usually found on the back of individual contact
                  sheets or photographs.</p>

                  <p>This subseries includes 104 contact sheets (97 black-and-white, 7 color) from
                     Belcher's photographic work in New York City streets and neighborhoods. Many
                     shots are from Belcher's days as a student at the New School for Social
                     Research and as a production assistant at NBC News in New York. Images include
                     portraits, landscapes, still lifes, cityscapes, and architecture; there are a
                     variety of experimental images as well.</p>

                  <p>This body of work explores the relationships between migration, identity and
                     history in the American Liberian experience. Belcher's interest in this topic
                     derived from his upbringing as a Philadelphia-born American who was raised in
                     Liberia for ten years beginning in 1954. The subseries includes 210
                     black-and-white contact sheets, 89 black-and-white photographs, 22 color
                     contact sheets and 10 color photographs. The earliest work, completed between
                     1971 and 1973, represents some of Belcher's first professional work as a
                     photographer. There is also additional fieldwork done in the years 1977-1978
                     and 1982-1983, featuring American Liberian architecture and portraiture of
                     indigenous Liberians and American Liberians. The exhibit catalog, <title
                        type="simple" render="italic">A Land and Life Remembered: Americo-Liberian
                        Folk Architecture,</title> available in the Rubenstein Rare Book &amp;
                     Manuscript Library, provides more information about these projects.</p>
                  <p>Belcher's subsequent work on Southern architecture (located in a separate
                     subseries) took him back to the origins of Liberian architecture in the
                     vernacular architecture of the American South. These examples of cultural
                     memory and historical continuity are discussed in both <title type="simple"
                        render="italic">A Land and Life Remembered</title> and <title type="simple"
                        render="italic">House and Home: Spirits of the South,</title> also held by
                     the Rubenstein Library. Belcher returned to the themes of migration, identity
                     and history in his later work in Samaná, Dominican Republic (also located in a
                     separate subseries). </p>

                  <p>The 165 contact sheets and 21 photographs in this subseries, all in
                     black-and-white, include experimental shots documenting Belcher's early and
                     continuing work with various grades and makes of film, paper and photographic
                     equipment. The images document a range of Belcher's photographic improvisations
                     and studies, as well as attempts at capturing various textures, scapes, and
                     light; and at composing with different angles and in varied photographic
                     settings. Thus, the subseries documents the development of Belcher's
                     photographic signature and style. The images include portraiture, architecture,
                     landscapes and cityscapes, and were shot in Massachusetts, Florida, and

                        Action Project (SMAP), in Somerville, Massachusetts, through a one-month
                        artist-in-residence program sponsored by the Massachusetts Cultural Council.
                        These selections from his SMAP work feature portraits of local teenagers, as

                  <p>Returning to the major themes of Belcher's earlier work in Liberia , this work
                     explores the relationships between migration, identity and history by
                     documenting African American emigration to and life in Samaná, Dominican
                     Republic. Specifically, the photographs portray the descendants of U.S. slave-
                     and free-born blacks who emigrated from Philadelphia to Samaná in 1824 and 1825
                     as part of a migration organized by the Haitian Emigration Society. For a
                     fuller description of this project, see Belcher's one-page description of his
                     work in Samaná, included in the printed materials series. The subseries
                     includes 51 black-and-white contact sheets, 4 black-and-white photographs, 96
                     color contact sheets, 98 color photographs, and 5 exhibition-quality, fine
                     color prints.</p>
