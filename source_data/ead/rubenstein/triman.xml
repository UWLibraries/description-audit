         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection consists largely of correspondence from Eugene Triman to Margaret Bond
            between December 1944 and April 1946. It is unclear how the couple met, but early
            letters indicate that Margaret was originally dating another man, "Bert." By August
            1945, Eugene and Margaret had begun dating, and by February 1946 they were engaged.
            There are a few letters from Margaret to Eugene in the weeks leading up to their
            marriage. Their wedding occurred in late April or early May, 1946. The last letter in
            the collection is from Margaret's mother in May 1946, wishing the couple a happy married
            life and enclosing photographs of the wedding ceremony.</p>
         <p>Most letters are from Eugene to Margaret, and largely center on his affection and love
            for her. He writes intimately about their relationship, and discusses their future, his
            expectations of her as his wife, his sexual desires, their need for birth control and
            contraceptives once married, his conversion to Catholicism, and his plans for employment
            and education following his discharge from the U.S. Navy. Other topics of interest are
            his activities and Navy life aboard submarines, particularly the USS Howard Gilmore, and
            his various deployments in New York, Florida, and other locations which were
            classified.</p>
         <p>Margaret's letters to Eugene center largely on the logistics of their wedding,
            particularly the requirement of a blood test in order to receive their marriage license. </p>
         <p>Other items in the collection are three clippings from local newspapers announcing
            Margaret's deployment as a servicewoman in the Women's Army Corps, dating from August
            1944.</p>

                  <p>In October 1945, Eugene tells Margaret that he was granted a 1-month leave. He
                     reports meeting up with his old friend, Charles Turk. He describes an incident
                     in which a French submarine appeared to sink some merchant ships. In his next
                     letter, he inquires about Margaret's change of address to W Reed Hospital in
                     Washington DC, expressing that he hopes that she is merely serving there and
                     not being treated for some injury. He offers encouragement when he hears that
                     she has decided to take a correspondence course.</p>

                  <p>Letters from Eugene to Margaret, discussing wedding plans. A series of letters
                     from mid-February (14-17) discuss birth control and the couple's need for
                     contraception, evaluating their options and discussing health and religious
                     concerns. This file includes two pamphlets on birth control sent by Eugene to
                     Margaret.</p>

                  <p>Love letters from Eugene to Margaret, continuing the discussion about birth
                     control. Eugene also describes being transferred off the U.S.S. Howard Gilmore
                     to a naval base, and a subsequent letter (Mar. 19) with the details of his
                     daily routine.</p>

                  <p>Love letters from Eugene to Margaret, including one letter in which he
                     expresses how much he likes her WAC uniform. Also includes some letters from
                     Margaret to Eugene, discussing wedding details and including the results of
                     their blood tests, a requirement for their marriage license in New Jersey.
                     Eugene also describes the search for housing, which proved to be more difficult
                     than anticipated. Unable to find an apartment for rent before the wedding, they
                     opt to stay in an extended-stay hotel for the first month while they look for a
                     permanent residence.</p>
