         <abstract id="aspace_dc1cd67ac6cebb5d05168410e94c6610">The Baltimore Pathological Society
            was formed in May 1853 by physicians Francis Donaldson, Charles Frick, Thomas H.
            Buckler, Thomas F. Murdock, Christopher Johntson, William C. Van Bibber, David Steuart
            and others. The first meeting of the society was held on June 11, 1853. Collection
            contains two manuscript volumes kept by the secretary of the society that provide a
            detailed record of the society's proceedings. Volume 1, dated 1853 to 1858, includes a
            membership list of the organizing members of the society, minutes of the first meeting
            held on June 11, 1853, and minutes of 84 additional meetings held from 1853 to 1858.
            Volume 2, dated 1867 to 1872, includes meeting minutes, roll calls, and the society's
            constition and by-laws. Both volumes document the society's discussion of cases and
            diseases and methods of treatment as well as medical demonstrations given at meetings.
            It appears that the society was re-organized in 1867 after an initial period of activity
            in the 1850s.</abstract>
