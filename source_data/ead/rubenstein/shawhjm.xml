         <p>H. J. M. Shaw (b. 1876) was an English mining engineer and businessman who spent much of
            his time in China between 1902 and 1909. He was often accompanied by his wife, Eva. He
            appears to be an employee of a large mining works in the Henan province of China during
            this time.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>This collection consists of the diary of H. J. M. Shaw (b. 1876), an English mining
            engineer and businessman. The diary covers the period 1902-1909 (predominantly the last
            2 years) and its entries provide insight into the life of a turn-of-the-century business
            and vacation traveler. The diary entries are typically brief day-to-day accounts of
            location, weather, and people met. There are occasionally longer anecdotes regarding
            stories he's heard or that were related to him, meetings with Chineses government
            officials, and reactions to events in the news. There are also a couple drawings where
            Shaw attempts to show what is causing his dental problems. The diary can be seen as two
            distinct parts. In the first part, entries commence on June 21, 1902 during the start of
            a trip to China and describe events while travelling across the Atlantic to New York and
            then North America by train across Canada to Vancouver. Shaw then travels abord the
            Empress of China to Yokahama, Japan and then on to China. The second part starts with
            entries in April 1908 while Shaw is travelling in a houseboat along the Hsun Hsien River
            in China with friends. The diary then describes Shaw's trip back to England with stops
            in Japan and Canada along the way. When back in England, entries describe his subsequent
            vacation trips to visit friends in Worcestershire and taking a vacation in Ireland.
            Entries from October to November 1908 describe his trip back to China this time through
            France, Italy, Egypt, Singapore and Hong Kong. The remainder of the diary describes his
            daily activities in Weihan, China which typically included work in the morning, a visit
            to the library to meet his Chinese teacher or to a golf club in the afternoon, and
            dinner with his wife and friends in the evening. The diary also contains two draft
            letters. The first is a letter dated June 18, 1903 to the chief engineer of the Henan
            mining works describing how he was treated during his visit. The other is dated June 9,
            1904 regarding the return of books from the mines to the Tientsin Municipal Library.
            There are also two newspaper clippings; one describing an explosion within the city of
            Canton, China and a letter to the editor response to an article in the China Times on
            Missionaries in China.</p>
