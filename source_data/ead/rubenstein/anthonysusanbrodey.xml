        B. Anthony wrote on National American Woman Suffrage Association letterhead in February 1905
        to Minnie C. Rodey, who was chair of the "Women's Club" in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In the
        letters, Anthony described informational material she will be sending Rodey, including a
        history of woman suffrage. In addition, she recommended a process by which the territory
        would vote on the issue of woman's suffrage before it acquiring statehood, since she
        considered the legislature and governor more likely to pass it than the general male voters
        in the state. She added, "... I read yesterday of the number of Indians and Mexicans and
        negroes that were in the territories. It is amazing that people want to make a state out of
        a territory composed of a majority of what we should term 'incompetents' Voting should be
        confined to intelligent beings." She also inquired of mutual friends and recommends her
        relatives who are visiting Albuquerque.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Susan B. Anthony was born February 15, 1820 in Adams, Massachusetts. She was brought up in
        a Quaker family with long activist traditions. Early in her life she developed a sense of
        justice and moral zeal. After teaching for fifteen years, she became active in temperance.
        Because she was a woman, she was not allowed to speak at temperance rallies. This
        experience, and her acquaintance with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, led her to join the women's
        rights movement in 1852. Soon after, she dedicated her life to woman suffrage. Ignoring
        opposition and abuse, Anthony traveled, lectured, and canvassed across the nation for the
        vote. She also campaigned for the abolition of slavery, the right for women to own their own
        property and retain their earnings, and she advocated for women's labor organizations. In
        1900, Anthony persuaded the University of Rochester to admit women. Anthony, who never
        married, was aggressive and compassionate by nature. She had a keen mind and a great ability
        to inspire. She remained active until her death on March 13, 1906.</p>
