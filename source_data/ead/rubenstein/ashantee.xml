            Invasion of Britain's Gold Coast protectorates began in December 1872. British forces
            responded with their own expedition and invasion of the Ashantee nation in January 1874,
            resulting in the Battle of Amoaful and the destruction of Kumasi. Materials in this
            collection consist of bound volumes and printings of reports, dispatches, and
            correspondence sent to Parliament during the Ashantee (also spelled Ashanti) invasion
            and the subsequent British expedition into Ashantee lands. Includes initial reports
            pre-dating the invasion, compilations of correspondence from the commanding officers
            leading the British forces, transcriptions of communications from the Ashantee king,
            negotiations regarding the Ashantee surrender, and reports from the Treasury about the
            cost of the expedition, both monetarily and in terms of British casualties.</abstract>

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>Years of tension on Africa's Gold Coast between Britain's protectorate states and the
            Ashantee (also spelled Ashanti) nation erupted with the launch of an Ashantee march
            towards Cape Coast Castle (in modern-day Ghana), beginning on 9 December 1872. By
            February 1873, the Ashantee had reached neighboring Fantee lands. Subsequent battles in
            March and April left the Fantee army defeated, and the invaders settled at Dunkwa with a
            force of 30,000 to 40,000 people. </p>
         <p>Throughout the early months of the invasion, the British had maintained their strict
            policy of non-intervention, leaving the Fantee people to defend themselves. This
            strategy changed with the battle of Elmina on 13 June 1873, when the British bombardment
            of the town (which was harboring Ashantee sympathizers) was interrupted by an assault of
            about 3000 Ashantee. The attack on the British led the Colonial Office to send an
            expedition to the Gold Coast.</p>
         <p>British forces, led by General Garnet Wolseley, sailed from Liverpool in September 1873
            with a dual mission: clear Ashantee invaders from the protectorate, and make a new
            treaty with the Ashantee nation. By the time they arrived, however, the Ashantee
            invaders had already retreated due to starvation and disease. Wolseley pressed the
            Ashantee king, Kofi Karikari, for impossible terms; when these were turned down, he
            launched an invasion of the Ashantee nation, culminating in the Battle of Amoaful on 31
            January 1874. British forces fired the town of Kumasi on 4 February 1874, and began
            their return march to Cape Coast Castle. The Ashantee nation was in such disarray that
            no one was able to sign the treaty. An embassy from the Ashantee king eventually met
            Wolseley at Cape Coast to officially surrender on 13 March 1874.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Materials in this collection consist of bound paperback volumes and compilations of
            reports, dispatches, and correspondence sent to Parliament during the Ashantee (also
            spelled Ashanti) invasion and the subsequent British expedition and retaliation. Items
            include initial reports from Gold Coast officials pre-dating the invasion, coverage of
            the Elmina battle, compilations of correspondence from the commanding officers leading
            the British forces, transcriptions of communications from the Ashantee king,
            negotiations regarding the Ashantee surrender, and reports from the Treasury about the
            cost of the expedition, both monetarily and in terms of British and allied casualties. </p>
         <p>The majority of the materials are copies of dispatches and reports, but the volumes also
            include occasional maps detailing the terrain and layout of cities and villages; tables
            and spreadsheets calculating casualties and expenses; and other miscellaneous notes and
            asides. Volumes have been organized in loose chronological order.</p>
