        Program (LHDFP) is administered by the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University to
        support documentary photographers who address humanitarian issues in the U.S. and abroad.
        The Lewis Hine Fellowship Photographs Collection represents a selection of images from the
        documentary projects of six LHDFP fellows: Alex Fattal, Maital Guttman, Kate Joyce, Elena
        Rue, Amanda van Scoyoc, and Lucy Wilson. The photographic images and videos in the
        collection depict home and community life of disadvantaged families and children in several
        sub-Saharan African nations (South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Ethiopia), as well as Boston,
        Massachusetts. They show everyday life and activities, such as children playing and
        completing chores, mothers cooking meals, disabled children going to school, household
        living conditions, and impoverished orphans and HIV-positive children in their familial
        situations, as well as funerals and school presentations (among other community events). In
        addition to photographic prints, there are also some documents relating to the projects, and
        DVDs of the photographers' documentary work. Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary
        Arts at Duke University.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>The Lewis Hine Documentary Fellows Program (LHDFP) is administered by the Center for
        Documentary Studies at Duke University to support documentary photographers who address
        humanitarian issues in the U.S. and abroad. The LHDFP is the first postgraduate program at
        Duke University's Center for Documentary Studies (CDS), and is part of a long-standing
        commitment to youth-focused work at the CDS. In order to work toward fulfilling this
        commitment, LHDFP places Fellows with organizations seeking creative solutions to the
        specific problems faced by women, adolescents, and children in poor, marginalized areas.
        Each year, Hines Fellows work with local organizations to document their chosen topic over
        the course of ten months. They then return to work with documentarians on their projects.
        Hine Fellows, selected each spring, are graduates of Duke University, the Robertson Scholars
        program between Duke and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, or of the Continuing
        Studies Certificate Program at the CDS. The Lewis Hine Documentary Fellows Program is
        supported by The Philanthropic Initiative and the Jessica Jennifer Cohen Foundation.</p>

      <p><emph render="bold">Alex Fattal</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Alex Fattal graduated from Duke in 2001 with a B.A. in comparative area studies. Alex is a
        photographer who has made images of rural family life in Russia, Cuba, and most recently, in
        Colombia on a Fulbright Fellowship. During his time in Colombia, Alex also collaborated with
        local NGOs on programming related to issues of sustainable development and children's
        rights. He spent he time as a Fellow in Durban, South Africa, where he worked with a local
        NGO in its efforts for children's rights advocacy. As part of his work there, he developed
        the body of work contained within this collection, entitled: <emph render="doublequote"
          >Images of Childhood in South Africa Ten Years after Apartheid.</emph>
      </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Maital Guttman</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Maital Guttman is a documentary filmmaker. As a freshman at Duke University her interest in
        documentary work began through the Humanitarian Challenges at Home and Abroad FOCUS Program.
        During her senior year she produced her first full-length documentary titled Mechina: A
        Preparation. The film follows six Israeli teens three months before they become soldiers,
        and sheds light on Israeli society in a way that reaches beyond general images of conflict.
        As a Lewis Hine Fellow, Guttman worked with an NGO in Nekkie, South Africa, and documented
        the stories of children that attend an arts-based HIV education center in South Africa.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Kate Joyce</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Kate Joyce studied sociology and photojournalism at San Francisco State University and,
        during fall 2003, worked on her Certificate in Documentary Studies through the Center for
        Documentary Studies. Kate is a photographer interested in the relationship between
        documentary processes and art. She spent seven months photographing in Chile, where she
        focused on female-headed households. Her fellowship project was spent in Bloemfontein, South
        Africa, photographing the body of work known as <emph render="doublequote">Site Insight:
          Mapping Grassland Phase II</emph>, and working on documentary projects with a local NGO
        (DEDI) that focuses on early childhood education and parental-empowerment in rural and
        informal settlements. She has also photographed in Iceland, Guatemala, Spain, and the
        American West. </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Elena Rue</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Elena Rue is a 2003 graduate of Kenyon College, where she studied anthropology and
        photography. During an intensive semester at the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke
        University (CDS) in 2001, she completed a number of undergraduate documentary studies
        courses and was involved with CDS's Youth Document Durham program and Student Action with
        Farmworkers, an organization housed at CDS. She spent that following spring semester in
        Ghana documenting the unique sign language of the isolated deaf community of Adamorobe. Rue
        spent nine months as a Fellow in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia working with an NGO that supports
        children whose families have been affected by HIV. The project she developed while working
        with these families is called <emph render="doublequote">Love After Loss.</emph>
      </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Amanda van Scoyoc</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Amanda van Scoyoc graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2005 with a B.A. in
        psychology and a minor in fine arts. For the last six years, she has worked on a variety of
        documentary projects, including a series of photographs, interviews, and writings about the
        impact that adopting nine-year-old Russian twin sisters has had on her family as well as on
        their own adjustment and development. She has also volunteered as a photographer with two
        nonprofits in Guatemala and Honduras, and worked as an art teacher at a Boy's Club of
        America, where she has incorporated journaling into her teaching. As a Fellow, van Scoyoc
        worked with an NGO in Chelsea, Mass. that helps at-risk youth become self-sufficient,
        responsible citizens. Her project regarding low-income and teenage mothers is entitled:
          <emph render="doublequote">Raising Them Right: Young Motherhood in Chelsea,
          Massachusetts.</emph>
      </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Lucy Wilson</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Lucy Wilson graduated from Duke in 2001 with a major in public policy studies. After
        graduation, Lucy lived in Ghana, where she worked for the United States Refugee Resettlement
        Program - Overseas Processing Entity (OPE), interviewing refugees throughout West Africa and
        leading circuit rides for the OPE field team. While at Duke, Lucy initiated Teaching
        Together, Learning Together, a partnership between Duke professors and Durham public school
        teachers. She was also a research assistant with CARE's Office of Public Policy and
        Governmental Relations, where she worked on a public advocacy campaign to increase
        international family-planning funding. As part of her coursework at the Center for
        Documentary Studies, she photographed a Nigerian family living in Chapel Hill, North
        Carolina. Wilson's project as a Fellow (<emph render="doublequote">The Highfield District of
          Harare, Zimbabwe</emph>) reflects her time with the NGO Child Protection Society (CPS), a
        local child rights advocacy organization in Zimbabwe.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Lewis Hine Fellowship Photographs Collection spans the years 2003-2008 and consists of
        selected images from the documentary collections of six of the Lewis Hine Documentary
        Fellows Program (LHDFP) fellows in the following locations: Alex Fattal (South Africa);
        Maital Guttman (South Africa); Kate Joyce (South Africa); Elena Rue (Ethiopia); Amanda van
        Scoyoc (Boston, Mass.); and Lucy Wilson (Zimbabwe). The photographic images and videos in
        the collection depict home and community life of disadvantaged and displaced families and
        children in several sub-Saharan African nations, as well as people in the communities of
        Chelsea and Boston, Massachusetts. Images show everyday life and activities, such as
        children playing and completing chores, mothers cooking meals, disabled children going to
        school, household living conditions, and impoverished orphans and HIV-positive children in
        their familial situations, as well as funerals and school presentations (among other
        community events). Several series reveal the after-effects of displacement and social
        conditions in post-apartheid South Africa (Kwazulu-Natal and Bloemfontein). Two of the
        photographers' projects also include black-and-white images taken by the children and their
        families, along with quotes from those individuals regarding the images.</p>
      <p>The collection consists of 147 color and black-and-white unmatted prints, ranging in size
        from 6.5x10 inches to 13x20 inches. There are also 4 DVDs containing both still- and
        moving-image documentaries with text and audio interviews. Several of the projects include
        paper copies of the introductions to the bodies of work, as well as full captions for the
        photographs. Many of the photographs are also available as digital images currently mounted
        on the LHDFP section of the CDS website.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
          <p>As a 2002-2003 Lewis Hine Documentary Fellow, Fattal became a documentary researcher
            for the <emph render="italic">Children's Rights Centre</emph> (CRC) in Durban, South
            Africa from February 2003 to August 2004. The CRC, initially a peace building
            organization during the violence in KwaZulu-Natal in the 1980s and early 1990s, has
            grown into a national non-governmental organization mobilizing and advocating for
            children's rights in every sector of South African society. Fattal's assignment was to
            explore challenges to children's rights in a qualitative, visual and participatory way,
            which he undertook over sixteen months by way of traveling to and stay with various
            households. While staying with these families, he worked with the children leading a
            series of discussions about photographs in their everyday environment and taught them
            the basics of framing, lighting, and operating a camera (which they then taught to their
            family members). Fattal's project (entitled <emph render="doublequote">Images of
              Childhood in South Africa Ten Years after Apartheid</emph>) consists of photographs in
            color that he took, and photographs in black and white that children and their parents
            or caregivers took. Various family members would tell stories about the images they
            would make, and these narratives are included below with the captions. (Note: all names
            and specific locations have been changed by Fattal.)</p>

          <p>As a Lewis Hine Fellow, Guttman spent the 2005-2006 academic year working with the 10
            Million Memory Project (10MMP), which is supported by the Regional Psycho-Social Support
            Initiative (REPSSI) and its partners. The purpose of these non-governmental
            organizations is to provide a therapeutic approach to healing psychological wounds in
            the southern region of Africa by way of creating safe spaces for children to share their
            memories and tell their life stories. More specifically, REPSSI is a non-profit regional
            organization that works to lessen the social and emotional effects of HIV and AIDS,
            poverty, and conflict among children and youth in thirteen countries in East and
            Southern Africa. Guttman was sent to Nekkie, South Africa to work with MADaboutART, an
            arts-based HIV education and youth empowerment program that is affiliated with 10MMP and
            REPSSI. While there, Guttman filmed a documentary entitled <emph render="doublequote"

            <p>This film is a documentary that highlights three Hero Book stories from MADaboutART,
              an arts-based HIV education center in South Africa. A Hero Book is a hand made book in

              with other youth their own strategies in the face of problems. The documentary guides
              the viewer through the stories of three HIV positive individuals (two children and one
              young adult) who have created Hero Books. The prompts for the sharing of their stories
              include: 1. My Self-Portrait; 2. My Community's Problems and Strengths; 3. An Early
              Memory; 4. My Problem; 5. One Shining Moment - When I Overcame My Problem; 6. Tricks

          <p>As a 2004-2005 academic year Lewis Hine Documentary Fellow, Joyce worked in South
            Africa with the nongovernmental organization Diketso Eseng Dipuo Community Development
            Trust (DEDI). This NGO focuses on empowering parents and facilitating early-childhood
            development programs in rural and informal settlements throughout South Africa's Free
            State province. Joyce was introduced to Grassland Phase II (the subject of her
            photograph series) through DEDI. Grassland Phase II is a government-subsidized
            settlement located on the fringe of an expanding black township in South Africa's
            judicial capital, Bloemfontein. This settlement was developed in an effort to address
            the land and housing needs of people living in the rapidly growing informal settlement
            of Bergman Square (a local municipality that was divided into 2,883 half-hectare [1.2
            acre] <emph render="italic">sites</emph> in 2003 and renamed Grassland Phase II).
            Subsidized urban settlements, like Grassland Phase II, provide residents with a
            springboard for growth and independence from living environments that are no longer
            sustainable; however, this type of development is still characterized by urban sprawl
            and racial segregation. The title of Joyce's project is: <emph render="doublequote"

          <p>As a 2005-2006 academic year Lewis Hine Fellow, Guttman worked with Hope for Children
            (HFC) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, beginning in January 2006. Hope for Children is a local,
            non-governmental organization that supports young children affected by HIV/AIDS by
            ensuring they have access to basic services, such as food, shelter, education, and
            medical care. HFC's seven group homes are the size of a traditional Ethiopian family
            (six to eight children) and are headed by a group home mother. Once the children are
            brought together and given everything they need, HFC steps back to allow them to become
            a family. Rue spent time in each of Hope for Children's group homes during her nine
            months in Ethiopia, and her photographs provide a sense of the family life within the
            group homes and give a face to the statistics within the media about HIV/AIDS orphans.
            All of the photographs were made by Rue in Ethiopia in 2006 for her project <emph
              render="doublequote">Love after Loss,</emph> and the names of the children have been
            changed to protect their identities. </p>
          <p>This collection includes twenty-one color photographs, one of which is a duplicate.
            There are seventeen 10.5 x 16" images, three 13 x 20" images, and one 15 x 15" image.
            Captions are taken from text of multimedia presentation.</p>

          <p>As a Lewis Hine Documentary Fellow, van Scoyoc spent the 2007-2008 academic year
            working with the nonprofit organization Roca, which means "rock" in Spanish. Located in
            Chelsea, a primarily immigrant, low-income neighborhood in Boston, Roca serves Greater
            Boston communities by helping at-risk youth become self-sufficient, responsible
            citizens. During her fellowship project, van Scoyoc worked closely with a group of six
            teenage mothers from a Roca parenting group to design a documentary project that would
            give them and 24 other young mothers from Roca an opportunity to tell their stories. She
            found that many these women focused their lives around the well-being of their children
            and, being familiar with the cycle of poverty, actively sought out opportunities to
            secure a better future for them. In order to document their stories, van Scoyoc made a
            formal portrait in each mother's home and conducted a detailed interview; then, each
            mother took her own photographs; and finally, van Scoyoc and the young women chose the
            images and mothers' own words that made up this exhibit. The title for van Scoyoc's
            project is: <emph render="doublequote">Raising Them Right: Young Motherhood in Chelsea,
              Massachusetts.</emph>

            scanned and printed with an Epson color printer. Captions taken from original texts.</p>

          <p>As a 2003-2004 Lewis Hine Documentary Fellow, Wilson spent six months in 2004 working
            with the Child Protection Society (CPS), a local child rights advocacy organization. CPS
            was established in 1952 to promote the rights of children in difficult circumstances in
            Zimbabwe. Wilson photographed and wrote about CPS's community-based child care project
            in the Highfield District, a low-income, high-density suburb of Harare, Zimbabwe's
            capital. CPS programming in Highfield includes educational sponsorship, food assistance,
            youth development, and psychosocial support, as well as community support to
            child-headed households whose parents have most likely died from HIV/AIDS. As part of
            the youth development programming, Wilson taught nine children and youth the basics of
            photography, giving them cameras and black-and-white film. She first asked the youth to
            write short essays on topics often drawn from the students' own interests. (The students
            wrote in English, their second or third language.) They were then encouraged to take
            photographs based on their writing. Once students developed the images, they selected
            their best pictures and wrote captions for them (which can be found in the Black and
            White Prints Subseries). These assignments asked the youth to reflect on the realities
            of their lives. Wilson's collection from her time in Zimbabwe is entitled <emph
