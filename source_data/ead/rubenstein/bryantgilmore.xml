         <p>Gilmore Ward Bryant (1859-1946), originally from a farm family in Bethel, Vermont,
            taught piano in many locations in New England and the South. He was reportedly invited
            to Durham by Washington Duke, who financed the design and construction for what was to
            become the Southern Conservatory of Music. Finished in 1898, the grand Italianate-style
            Conservatory stood on the corner of Main and Duke Street. </p>
         <p>Bryant was its founder and director until his retirement sometime in the 1930s, and his
            wife Mattie Emily Bullard Bryant, an accomplished musician and teacher, served as head
            of the Voice Department; his daughter-in-law also served as a teacher. Bryant was also a
            composer, publishing many pieces from the 1890s through the 1930s.</p>
         <p>According to Mattie's diary, in the summer of 1923, the Bryants purchased their own land
            and laid the cornerstone for a new Conservatory on South Alston Avenue, then open
            countryside, and the old Conservatory was demolished in 1924. Mattie Bryant passed away
            in 1934; Gilmore Ward Bryant in 1946, in Durham. Their only son, Max Wylie Bryant,
            worked at Erwin Mills and continued to live in Durham until his death in 1967.</p>

         <head>Content Description</head>
         <p>Gilmore Ward Bryant (1859-1946), originally from Bethel, Vermont, founded the Southern
            Conservatory of Music in Durham in 1898 or 1899, along with his wife, Mattie E. Bryant.
            The collection contains seven diary volumes: five by James Alonzo Bryant, Gilmore's
            father and a Vermont farmer, containing brief entries related to the weather, visitors,
            farm tasks and sales, and church activities; and two by Mattie Bryant, containing brief
            entries about weather, church activities, visitors, and Conservatory events. </p>
         <p>The collection is rich in photographs depicting members of the Bryant, Clark, Bird,
            Dean, Chamberlain, and McConoll families from Vermont, and others. There are 19th and
            early 20th century tintypes, many mounted in two small personal albums; an ambrotype; an
            albumen print; and gelatin silver photographs.</p>
         <p>The Conservatory's history and Bryant's career in music are represented by published and
            manuscript sheet music composed by Bryant (there is also one piece by P.A. Schnecker),
            and a sheet of examination grades. A copy of the 77-page illustrated "Calendar" of the
            Southern Conservatory of Music, contains information about its mission, faculty,
            administration, facilities, and programs, accompanied by many images of the Conservatory
            building, its faculty and staff, interior rooms, and students at practice.</p>

               <p>Set of diaries include several kept by James Alonzo Bryant, farmer in Bethel,
                  Vermont (1871-1878), in which Gilmore Bryant is mentioned as helping his father
                  with farm chores and going away to school. Brief entries typcially mention the
                  weather, visits, church activities, and farm tasks and sales. Mattie E. Bryant's
                  1921 and 1923 diaries follow the same pattern, with brief entries focused on
                  visits and health, and, as wife and partner of Gilmore W. Bryant, on Conservatory
                  activities such as lessions, concerts, and the school calendar. She mentions in
                  1923 that Trinity Church burned down; later that spring, she writes of closing the
                  old Conservatory in downtown Durham and moving to Alston Avenue, then open country
                  ("just like camping out".</p>

                  <p>Small leather-covered decorative album (3.5x3.5 inches) contains 20 tintype
                     portraits of family and friends. They are almost all 16th-plate size (about
                     1.375 x 1.625 inches or 3.5 x 4 cm). The first is of a man, E. McCollom, a last
                     name associated with the Bryant family (and spelled various ways in historical
                     records); there are also related family members by the name of Clark. Other
                     family names that all appear to be relations include Bird, Bundy, Durkee, Dean,
                     Chamberlain, and Hatch. Many are children.</p>
