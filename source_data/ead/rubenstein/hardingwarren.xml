      <abstract id="aspace_0cc520d32dd6392d56214dd022861228">Collection comprises a letter written
        by the United States Senator from Ohio Warren G. Harding to the suffragist Harriet Taylor
        Upton regarding support for women's suffrage. Harding responds to a telegram from Upton
        asking him to use his influence on Ohio State Senator U.G. Murrell in support of women's
        voting rights. Harding replies that he is "reluctant" to advise Murrell on the matter
        because of his previous experience with Murrell while Harding was a member of the Ohio
        General Assembly. </abstract>

      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Warren G. Harding was the 29th President of the United States and a member of the
        Republican party. He served as the United States Senator from Ohio from 1915-1921. On the
        issue of suffrage, Harding first indicated that he could not support votes for women until
        his Ohio constituents did. By the time support for suffrage increased and was voted on by
        the Senate in 1918, Harding was a supporter. Although Harding was popular in his time,
        scandals that later came to light have caused him to be remembered as one of the worst
        Presidents in history. </p>
      <p>Harriet Taylor Upton was a women's suffrage activist who was nationally known for her work
        in the struggle for women's right to vote. She was the president of the Ohio Woman Suffrage
        Association at the time of this letter. Upton made an unsuccessful bid for election to the
        U.S. House of Representatives in 1926, and was the first woman to become a vice chairperson
        of the Republican National Committee. She was also active in the temperance movement and an
        author of both children's books and histories.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The collection consists of a single autograph typescript letter on Senator Warren G.
        Harding's United States Senate letterhead dated 1917 February 11. Senator Harding writes to
        suffragist Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton of Warren, Ohio, "I beg to acknowledge your telegram of
        February 4. By reason of my former experience as a member of the Senate of Ohio General
        Assembly, I would be reluctant to advise Senator Murrell of Clinton County as to his
        ultimate action on the suffrage matter." Murrell was a member of the Ohio General Assembly.
        By 1917, Senator Harding was prepared to vote in the affirmative on the issue of women's
        suffrage. Harriet Upton was was hoping to leverage his influence to generate similar support
        in their home state of Ohio.</p>
