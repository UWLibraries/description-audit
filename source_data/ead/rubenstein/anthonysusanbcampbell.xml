      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Susan B. Anthony was born February 15, 1820 in Adams, Massachusetts. She was brought up in
        a Quaker family with long activist traditions. Early in her life she developed a sense of
        justice and moral zeal. After teaching for fifteen years, she became active in temperance.
        Because she was a woman, she was not allowed to speak at temperance rallies. This
        experience, and her acquaintance with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, led her to join the women's
        rights movement in 1852. Soon after, she dedicated her life to woman suffrage. Ignoring
        opposition and abuse, Anthony traveled, lectured, and canvassed across the nation for the
        vote. She also campaigned for the abolition of slavery, the right for women to own their own
        property and retain their earnings, and she advocated for women's labor organizations. In
        1900, Anthony persuaded the University of Rochester to admit women. Anthony, who never
        married, was aggressive and compassionate by nature. She had a keen mind and a great ability
        to inspire. She remained active until her death on March 13, 1906.</p>
