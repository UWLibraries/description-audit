          <p>This large series consists chiefly of handwritten drafts of sermons given by John
            Wilson Fleming during his service as pastor to several churches in North Carolina. Some
            of the later versions are computer print-outs. The sermons often offer insights into the
            religious aspects of African American life and history, the civil rights movement, and
            race relations.</p>
