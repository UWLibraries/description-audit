      <abstract id="aspace_edc6c89a2a82cc86e4c3a7e1bc958381">The Aitken family was of Scottish
        descent. John Aitken, senior, lived in Rashiehill, Scotland. One of his sons, James Aitken,
        was eventually ordained as a Presbyterian minister in Elizabeth town (Elizabeth City), North
        Carolina. Collection comprises a letter written by James Aitken to his parents from
        Wilmingtown (Wilmington), North Carolina, on 1775 June 5, as well as a last will and
        testament for John Aitken, Senior, as recorded in 1793. In his letter, James describes local
        people as "genteel" and respected for their "education and good behaviour," and goes on to
        describe local planters and their various crops, long distances ridden, the situation for
        Presbyterians and his upcoming ordination and resettlement, his plans to obtain a plantation
        and purchase or hire slaves, preparations for war with Great Britain, and payment of his
        debts. In his will, John Aitken, Senior, names his son, John, as his successor, and outlines
        the distribution of his money, land, and property. The will is witnessed by Charles Lang and
        William Muirhead.</abstract>
