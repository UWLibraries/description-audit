      <head>Historical note</head>
      <p>Joseph L. Blumenstein (1914-1982) was a Jewish United States Army officer and merchant of
        Fayetteville (Cumberland Co.), North Carolina. He was born Josef Leo Blumenstein in Berlin,
        Germany, where he was educated at Jewish schools and trained to become a tailor. He
        emigrated from Germany to Czechoslovakia in 1937 and to the United States in 1938. During
        World War II, Blumenstein served in the United States Army and was stationed at Fort Bragg,
        North Carolina, where he married Florence Fleishman of Fayetteville. He was later stationed
        at Fort Benning, Georgia, as an instructor for the Tactical Section of the Infantry School.
        He was also involved in the interrogation of German prisoners and the postwar training of
        Germans for service in the Office of Military Government. After the war, Blumenstein and his
        family remained in Fayetteville, where they owned and operated the Capitol Food Store and
        were members of the Beth Israel Congregation.</p>
