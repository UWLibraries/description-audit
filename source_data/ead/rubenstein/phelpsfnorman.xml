         <abstract id="aspace_83ba1eaa6c59dc44b35131cd23117027">F. Norman Phelps was a Chevrolet
            sales executive in various cities, including Milwaukee, Wisc.; Detroit, Mich.,
            Davenport, Ia.; Kansas City, Mo.; and Los Angeles, Calif. Full name: Fredrick Norman
            Phelps; b. 20 March 1895 in Bucyrus (Crawford County), Ohio; d. 23 January 1974 in
            Piedmont, Calif. Collection comprises a scrapbook (about 54 pgs) documenting Phelps'
            career as a Chevrolet sales executive. Includes primarily newspaper clippings and
            black-and-white photographs, although there are also such items as letters, telegrams,
            news releases, programs (including those for national auto exhibits, sales conventions,
            and other events), menus, song lyric sheets, a medallion name tag, and other ephemera,
            all housed in a leather "Chevrolet Sales Speeder" three-ring binder. The newspaper
            clippings and letters document Phelps' various transfers and promotions; other items
            cover topics such as company-sponsored hunting events, meals, outings, vintage cars, and
            skits. There is only one unrelated item: a newspaper clipping from 1926 tells of Phelps'
            escape from a house fire.</abstract>
