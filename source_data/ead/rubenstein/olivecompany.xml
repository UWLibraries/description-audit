            Clarinda, Ia. Collection comprises printed material supporting the purchase of the
            National Bust Developer, a vacuum appliance. Includes an advertising pamphlet (15 pgs.)
            for "perfect bust development," an order blank, and a sheet of endorsements. The
            advertising pamphlet explains flat-chestedness as follows: "In the natural order of
            things, maternity would have occurred early enough to prevent the loss of the busts. The
            development of the busts is greatly dependent upon the maternal instincts. The tendency
            of the day is to postpone marriage much beyond the age demanded by Nature. Hence it is
            that there are a multitude of women who are well developed in all other respects, but
            find to their chagrin that the busts are gradually disappearing." (p. 6)</abstract>
