      <p>The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) was one of the most important
        organizations of the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. It emerged from a student
        meeting organized by Ella Baker held at Shaw University in April 1960. SNCC grew into a
        large organization with many supporters in the North who helped raise funds to support
        SNCC's work in the South, allowing full-time SNCC workers to have a $10 per week salary.
        Many unpaid volunteers also worked with SNCC on projects in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia,
        Arkansas, and Maryland. SNCC played a major role in the sit-ins and freedom rides, a leading
        role in the 1963 March on Washington, Mississippi Freedom Summer, and the Mississippi
        Freedom Democratic Party over the next few years. SNCC's major contribution was in its field
        work, organizing voter registration drives all over the South, especially in Georgia,
        Alabama, and Mississippi.</p>
