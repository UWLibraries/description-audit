      <abstract id="aspace_84d6532112d2a449b01c9ace0971053c">Collection contains a scrapbook for the
        1913 Suffrage Pilgrimage, describing the route from Birkenhead to London. This is
        accompanied by 78-page narrative of the trip, which is keyed to the photographs in the
        scrapbook. Also included are two other drafts of the narrative, "A few impressions" (14
        pages) and "The Suffrage Pilgrimage, July 1913" (88 pages). The scrapbook and narratives
        were possibly prepared by Alice Margery New. Her "Suffrage Quotation Book" that contains
        signatures of suffragists, including those of Constance Lytton and Emmeline Pankhurst, is
        also present. In addition, there is another unidentified participant's description (31
        pages) of the Birkenhead to London pilgrimage, perhaps written by Alice's mother or aunt.
        There are five postcards related to the pilgrimage, along with a black-and-white photograph
        of F. W. Pathick Lawrence, who was imprisoned for his association with militant suffrage
        demonstrations. Finally, the collection contains an autograph book (1858-1931) containing
        primarily letters directed to William Newmarch, but with a few Dalby and New family items. </abstract>

      <p>The New family was based in Cheshire, England. Roland New (1856-1941) married Alice Dalby
        (1858-?) in 1886. The couple had five children, Mary Rachel (1888-), Alice Margery
        (1890-1975), Roland Henry (1892-1972), Hilda Cowling (1894-1951), and Gladys Dalby
        (1896-1992). The family resided in Oxton, then Birkenhead.</p>
