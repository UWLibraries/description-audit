      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Correspondence sent to Sir William MacGregor primarily during his tenure as governor of
        Lagos Colony, Nigeria. One letter was written from Lagos in 1918. Topics include the new
        government when Northern Nigeria became a British protectorate, the West African Frontier
        Force, water sourcing, the rubber trade, and liquor traffic. All letters are signed and the
        majority are manuscript, except for two that are typed. Includes one black-and-white 6x10 cm
        photograph of an Nigerian family outside their hut.</p>
      <p>There is one letter (1899 March 11) from Frederick Butler, a clerk in the Nigeria
        Department of the Colonial Office, writing that he is sending literature, including a report
        on the liquor traffic in West Africa. There are two letters (1899 August 6 and 1899 August
        30) from John Balie Henderson, a leading engineer for the Queensland Water Supply
        Department, regarding water bores and the Great Artesian Basin. There are also two letters
        written by Sir Reginald Laurence Antrobus, crown agent for the colonies and a civil servant
        in the Colonial Office, one letter (1899 October 15) regarding the new Niger Administration
        and financial management, the other letter (1904 June 9) regarding a scandal, "the report
        that the acting Resident proposed to hoist the British flag in Ibadan is wholly untrue....
        it seems undesirable to make too much of it." A letter (1900 April 26) from the Colonial
        Secretariat at Lagos deals largely with the liquor trade and describes movement of the West
        African Frontier Force. There is a letter (1901 April 21) from Sir Ralph Moor, the first
        high commissioner of the British Southern Nigeria Protectorate, regarding details of the
        rubber trade. The letter includes the photograph of a Nigerian family. Finally, there is a
        letter from the Chief Justice at Lagos, A. R. Gunnington, regarding the his unfair
        replacement.</p>
