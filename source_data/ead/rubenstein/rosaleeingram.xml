         <abstract id="aspace_5d179f8246221e71ff054ae1d6f09ee1">The collection includes three
            publications related to the campaign to free Mrs. Rosa Lee Ingram, an African American
            sharecropper and widowed mother of twelve in southwest Georgia, along with two of her
            sons, Wallace and Sammie Lee Ingram, who were serving life sentences for the 1947 death
            of their white sharecropper neighbor, John Ethron Stratford. The handling of the case
            aroused concern about racial injustice in the southern judicial system which led to the
            formation of a national campaign for clemency. Through the efforts of the African
            American community, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
            (NAACP), and the communist-influenced Civil Rights Congress (CRC), the Ingrams' original
            death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment in 1948 and eventual release in 1959.
            The three items in the collection were published in 1954, when publicity for the case
            was largely coordinated by the Women's Committee for Equal Justice, an off-shoot of the
            CRC headed by the civil rights activist, Mary Church Terrell. Although not explicitly
            dated, two items were clearly issued in early May: A broadside from the Women's
            Committee for Equal Justice in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and a four page newsletter
            from the New York headquarters of the Women's Committee for Equal Justice designed to
            raise support for the May 9th and 10th Mother's Day crusade for the freedom of Mrs. Rosa
            Lee Ingram and her sons. The earliest item is a four page newsletter published in
            February 1954 by the Pennsylvania Civil Rights Congress, Let Freedom Ring, volume 1,
            number 3. The cover page includes an article titled Goal for '54: Free Mrs. Ingram that
            recounts earlier efforts in the fight to free Mrs. Ingram and her sons and announces
            future campaign activities including plans to demand support from the Attorney General,
            Herbert Brownell, and the Secretary of the United Nations.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The collection includes three publications related to the campaign to free Mrs. Rosa Lee
            Ingram, an African American sharecropper and widowed mother of twelve in southwest
            Georgia, along with two of her sons, Wallace and Sammie Lee Ingram, who were serving
            life sentences for the 1947 death of their white sharecropper neighbor, John Ethron
            Stratford. The handling of the case aroused concern about racial injustice in the
            southern judicial system which led to the formation of a national campaign for clemency.
            Through the efforts of the African American community, the National Association for the
            Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the communist-influenced Civil Rights
            Congress (CRC), the Ingrams' original death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment
            in 1948 and eventual release in 1959.</p>
         <p>The three items in the collection were published in 1954, when publicity for the case
            was largely coordinated by the Women's Committee for Equal Justice, an off-shoot of the
            CRC headed by the civil rights activist, Mary Church Terrell. The broadside issued by
            the Women's Committee for Equal Justice in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, includes a quote
            from Mrs. Ingram; a reprint of <title type="simple" render="italic">The Philadelphia
               Tribune</title> article about the case dated May 8, 1954; an appeal to readers to
            contact Governor Herman Talmadge in Atlanta, Georgia; and a contribution form.</p>
         <p>Also included in the collection is a four page newsletter issued by the New York
            headquarters of the Women's Committee for Equal Justice designed to raise support for
            the May 9th and 10th <emph render="doublequote">Mother's Day crusade for the freedom of
               Mrs. Rosa Lee Ingram and her sons,</emph> in which Mary Church Terrell and supporters
            plan to campaign for the Ingrams' freedom at the Georgia State Capital and at a national
            conference in Atlanta. The newsletter includes photographs of a December 1953 protest in
            Georgia, Mrs. Ingram's children, and Mary Church Terrell; details about the case; quotes
            from Mrs. Ingram and others; a 28-line statement by Terrell, and a contribution
            form.</p>
         <p>The earliest item in the collection is a four page newsletter published in February 1954
            by the Pennsylvania Civil Rights Congress, <title type="simple" render="italic">Let
