        artist and printmaker. Collection consists of two black-and-white letterpress posters on
        22x14 inch cardboard. The first poster reads, "Black lives matter: it ain't what the news
        told ya!" The second reads, "Is America the America I learned to imagine?" The original
        posters were created and published in Pope's book, <title render="italic">The Appearance of
          Black Lives Matter</title> (2018). Pope then re-created them in 2020 in response to
        current Black Lives Matter movement events, distributing copies of the posters to movement
        participants for the purpose of displaying them in their respective communities. Acquired by
        the John Hope Franklin Research Center for African and African American History and

      <p>Carl Robert Pope, Jr., known as Carl Pope, is an African American artist who works
        primarily in photography, video, and graphic art. Much of his work addresses issues related
        to race in America, police brutality, and what it means to be Black in America. He has also
        created artwork that relates to the AIDS epidemic and other social and political issues in
        the United States. He was born in 1961 in Indianapolis, Indiana and received his arts
        degrees from Bloomington University in Illinois. </p>
      <p>He published the art book <title render="italic">The appearance of Black Lives
          Matter</title> in 2018 with Nicholas Mirzoeff; it is described by the publisher as "An
        intertextual conversation between artist Carl Pope and writer Nicholas Mirzoeff on the
        issues surrounding Ferguson, Baltimore and the activism of Black Lives Matter." </p>
