      <p>Sir George Thomas Staunton (1781-1859) was the only surviving child of Sir George Leonard
        Staunton (1737-1801) who was born in County Galway, Ireland. George Leonard Staunton
        graduated M. D. from a college at Montpelller, France, in 1758, and he lived on Grenada, B.
        W. I., during most of the 1760s and 1770s. His first diplomatic missions were from
        1781-1784, when he was secretary to George Macartney, First Earl Macartney, who was Governor
        of Madras. From 1792-1794, the senior Staunton was secretary in the first British mission
        that was sent to China, the Macartney Mission. George Thomas Staunton’s mother Jane
        (Collins) Staunton, was the daughter of Benjamin Collins, a banker of Salisbury.</p>
      <p>George Thomas Staunton accompanied his father to China from 1792-1794. During 1798-1817 he
        was writer, supercargo, member of the Select Committee, and, finally, chief of the East
        India Company's factory at Canton. From 1816-1817 Staunton was a ranking member of Britain’s
        second mission to China. After 1817 he lived in England and was an M. P. during most of the
        period from 1818-1852.</p>
      <p>Ships on which Sir George Thomas Staunton sailed to and from China were the Hindustan,
        Arniston, Bombay, Charles Grant, Wexford, Discovery, Alceste, and Scaleby Castle. These
        vessels sailed for the East India Company. Numerous other ships are noted in the diaries and
        letters from China.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The papers of Sir George Thomas Staunton, a politician and author of works on China,
        include correspondence with his father Sir George Leonard Staunton (1737-1801) and mother
        Jane (Collins) Staunton describing his education, his life at the East India Company's
        factory in Canton (1798-1817), several disputes with Chinese officials, and Lord Amherst's
        mission to China (1816-1817). A few letters relate to France and England from 1780 to 1792,
        Paris social life, the French National Assembly, and British attitudes toward the French
        Revolution. Letters to his mother during periods of travel in England and Ireland
        (1802-1819) describe his examination of various country estates there. There are also
        letters written while touring France, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, and Belgium.</p>
      <p>Several letters to George Leonard Staunton (father of George Thomas Staunton) concern the
        senior Staunton's diplomatic career, the negotiation of a treaty with the ruler of Mysore in
        1783, British rule of Madras and Calcutta (1781-1784 and 1791), his part in the mission to
        China (1792), and family and personal matters.</p>
      <p>This collection contains six travel diaries authored by George Thomas Staunton. Five were
        written during childhood travels with his father in Europe and China, from 1791 to
        approximately 1796. There is another travel diary dated 1826-1830 and a journal from
        1831-1837 which records Staunton's opinions on parliamentary matters, his voting record, a
        list of correspondents, draft letters, and other political information, especially
        concerning the Reform Bill of 1832. </p>
      <p>Letters are arranged chronologically. Many letters are from members of the Collins and
        Staunton families. Correspondents include: E. C. Bentley, Edward Blakeney, Lucy B.
        (Staunton) Cormick, Richard Blake, W. Leonard (?), John Staunton, Margaret (Leonard)
        Staunton, Thomas Staunton, Sam Simcockes, and Alyward L. Staunton, Peter B. Brodie, Benjamin
        Collins, Benjamin C. Collins, Mary Collins, and Barfoot Cotton. The correspondence indicates
        that Staunton wrote frequently to Sir John Barrow, Secretary to the Admiralty and close
        friend of the family, but this collection has only one of these items. There is a sizeable
        group of letters from Henry John Temple, Third Viscount Palmerston. </p>

          <p>This volume contains entries regarding Staunton’s parliamentary activities and
            opinions, drafts of letters, and more than eighty clippings. Topics include the Reform
            Bill of 1832; the parliamentary election of 1835 in South Hampshire, in which the reform

          <p>Bound volume (former call number E K53P) regarding the Staunton seat in England: Leigh
            Park. Contains two titles: A Poem on Leigh Park, the seat of Sir George Thomas Staunton,
            bart. by James King (London: Whittaker, Treacher, 1829) and Letters Addressed to William
            Garrett, esq., relative to the state of Leigh House. (Havant, Hampshire, England: Havant
            Press, printed by H. Skelton, 1819). These twenty letters testify to the sound condition
            of Leigh House at the time when Garrett repossessed it from John Julius Angerstein.
            Staunton bought Leigh House in January 1820.</p>
          <p>The volume was originally printed with 52 blank pages at the end. 33 pages of this
            section contain entries most likely written by George Thomas Staunton from 1819-1858
            pertaining to events of personal interest, improvements at Leigh Park, purchases of real
            estate, employment of tenants and workers, national affairs, and a list of visitors to
            Leigh Park. Eight newspaper clippings are mounted on the fly-leaves. Two items relate to
