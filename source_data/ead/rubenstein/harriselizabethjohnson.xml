      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Elizabeth Johnson Harris was a writer born in Augusta, Georgia, in 1867, the daughter of
        formerly enslaved parents. She married Jacob Walker Harris in 1883 at the age of 15 and bore
        nine children. She lived until 1942, surviving her husband and two of her children. She was
        a deeply religious woman who spent much of her life in service to her church. She valued
        education, both for herself and for her children. Her son, Charles Jacob Harris (1885-1998)
        was a classically trained pianist and composer. Harris' poems, plays and vignettes were
        published in various outlets during her lifetime. She included these in the manuscript of
        her life story, which she started writing at the age of 55 in 1923.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>85-page handwritten manuscript in a bound notebook. It starts on the front side of the
        pages until the end of the notebook, where it continues from back to front on the backs of
        the pages. It covers her life in chronological order with the exception of some earlier
        stories recounted in later sections.</p>
      <p>Harris divided the memoir into two sections: her childhood years and her life during and
        after her courtship and marriage. The manuscript also includes tipped in photographs and
        newsclippings. The photograph on the inside front cover above the dedication is an image of
        Johnson's adult daughter, Mattie Louise. The appendix contains the majority of the
        clippings, which consist of her poetry, several folk tales, and news stories about the
        Harris family.</p>
      <p>The memoir describes Harris' childhood in Augusta, GA, race relations, her ambivalence
        about her place in society as an African-American, and the importance of religion and
        education in her life. She includes the story of her courtship and marriage, as well as
        descriptions of the adult lives of several of her children. Her son Charles Jacob Harris
        (1885-1988), was a classically trained pianist, composer, and teacher whose papers are also
        held by the Rubenstein Library. </p>
