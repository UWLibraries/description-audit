         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The Pepperidge Farm Company was begun in 1937 by Margaret Rudkin, who lived at her
            family's farm (called Pepperidge Farm) in Fairfield, Connecticut. Rudkin's son suffered
            allergies from preservatives in commercial bread products, so she began baking
            all-natural breads in her home kitchen that he might safely eat. She moved her
            operations from the kitchen to her garage, and began selling loaves to specialty stores
            in Manhattan. In 1939, she sold her 500,000th loaf. The following year, she moved
            operations to a nearby factory, where she was able to produce 4,000 loaves a week. In
            1947, the company moved again to a large facility in Norwalk, Connecticut, and began
            selling stuffing and dinner rolls in addition to bread; by this point the company was
            producing 4,000 loaves of bread per hour.</p>
         <p>During the 1950s, the company began running television commercials, and initiated their
            Distinctive Cookies product line based on a recipe Rudkin had purchased from a European
            company. That decade, Rudkin also purchased the New Hampshire frozen pastries company,
            Black Horse Pastry Company, allowing Pepperidge to sell Puff Pastry. In 1961, Pepperidge
            Farm, Inc. was acquired by the Campbell Soup Company; the following year, the
            newly-owned company released its popular Goldfish line of crackers, borrowing the idea
            from Swiss companies. In 1963, Rudkin released a cookbook entitled, <title type="simple"
               render="italic">The Margaret Rudkin Pepperidge Farm Cookbook</title>, which became
            the first cookbook to feature on the <title type="simple" render="italic">New York
               Times</title> Bestseller List. Rudkin retired in 1966.</p>
