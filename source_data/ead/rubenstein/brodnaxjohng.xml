            professional and family correspondence of three generations of the Brodnax family,
            centering around John G. Brodnax. Pre-Civil War letters refer to the sale of slaves;
            wartime correspondence reflects the fear of the advancing Union forces. Postwar papers
            include Brodnax's appointment as assistant surgeon general of a North Carolina hospital
            at Petersburg, Va., overseeing the discharge of disabled Confederate soldiers, and his
            oath of allegiance to the United States. Also includes letters to his wife during her
            summer visits with relatives. Many papers concern Mrs. Brodnax's activities in the
            Daughters of the American Revolution and the United Daughters of the Confederacy; others
            relate to attendance of family members at various North Carolina and Virginia schools
            and colleges. There are also letters from Germany and Europe in the 1870s and 1880s and
            Mexico in 1910.</abstract>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>This collection contains family correspondence of three generations of the Brodnax
            family centering chiefly around John G. Brodnax (1829-1907), a Confederate surgeon and
            practicing physician. </p>
         <p>Letters from 1857 to 1867, generally from Lynchburg, Virginia, refer to the sale of
            slaves and, during the war years, are concerned with the question of fleeing or
            remaining to face the advancing Federals. Included also are Brodnax's appointment as
            assistant surgeon general of the North Carolina Hospital at Petersburg, Virginia, and
            his oath of allegiance to the United States. Other items pertaining to Dr. Brodnax are
            letters to his wife, beginning in 1881, while she visited her relatives in summer, a
            speech against railroad taxation in 1879, a group of petitions in 1877 requesting that
            Brodnax be made superintendent of the North Carolina State Insane Asylum, and an undated
            article on optical surgery. Included also is genealogical material as well as other
            materials connected with the activities of Brodnax's wife in the Daughters of the
            American Revolution and the United Daughters of the Confederacy. </p>
         <p>A number of letters were written from schools and colleges attended by members of the
            family, including Salem Female Academy, Salem, North Carolina, and St. Mary's College,
            Raleigh, North Carolina, during 1912; N. I. Smith's School in Leaksville during 1879 and
            1880; Bingham School in Orange County during 1883; Bingham School in Asheville, and Old
            Point Comfort College, Virginia, after 1909. </p>
         <p>Also included in the collectoon are letters from Mrs. Barr, an aunt of Mrs. Brodnax, and
            her children from 1877 to 1884 while traveling in Europe and studying music in Germany.
            There are letters from Mary (Brodnax) Glenn and her family while in Mexico, where her
            husband worked for a railroad company, a mining firm, and as secretary to the American
            consul general; letters of this period are filled with references to conditions in
            Mexico, especially concerning political upheavals around 1910. Included also are papers
            relative to the settlement of the estate of John Brodnax, Jr., after 1909, and a group
            of sermons delivered by James Kerr Burch, a Presbyterian minister and father-in-law of
            Dr. John G. Brodnax.</p>
