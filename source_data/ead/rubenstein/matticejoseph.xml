      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Joseph F. Mattice Papers include correspondence, newspaper clippings, photographs, and
        ephemera ranging from 1929-1985. The material is organized into six series: Asbury Park New
        Jersey Riots July 1970, Correspondence, Photographs, Ephemera, Newspaper Clippings, and
        Audiovisual materials. There is also one oversize folder consisting of a political flyer and
        two magazines. Mattice acquired the materials during his career as a student at Georgetown
        University, lawyer, city council member, district court judge, and Monmouth County board of
        elections member. Mattice was mayor of Asbury Park during the July 1970 riots. The riots
        lasted from July 4-10, 1970. They began in reaction to the African American communityâ€™s
        frustration with employment discrimination and the poor living conditions in the
        predominately African American West side neighborhood. The riots caused significant damage
        to the West Side, 167 people were arrested, and local and State police were summoned. In the
        end, city government and West Side residents worked together to come to a resolution. The
        Asbury Park July 1970 riots brought national attention to the town, which is documented via
        the received correspondence, clippings, and ephemera in the collection. </p>
      <p>The later correspondence consists of personal letters and papers coupled with newspaper
        clippings pertaining to politics in Asbury Park and Monmouth County as a whole.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>This series contains material related to the July 1970 riots. The riots were sparked by
            the lack of employment for African Americans due to discrimination and poor living
            conditions on the west side of Asbury Park, a predominately African American
            neighborhood. All correspondence in this series is incoming. Series contains letters
            from supporters of segregation and hate speech. Letters expressing criticism towards the
            Mattice administration are prevalent. Some of the letters advise Mattice to punish the
            rioters, while other letters accuse Mattice of not being supportive of the African
            American community. In contrast, there are letters from concerned citizens fearful of
            the riots, and letters calling for peace. This series includes clippings and other news
            coverage from the riots, as well as a small assortment of letters of advice to Mayor
            Mattice.</p>
