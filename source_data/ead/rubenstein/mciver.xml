        North Carolina, in the early and mid-20th century. This collection contains postcard albums
        with examples of tourism postcards and seasonal or holiday cards collected by William
        McIver's family in the 1910s-1920s, as well as letters sent to Marjorie McIver from elected
        officials responding to her opinions on pending legislation, like the Bardon Education Bill.
        The collection contains examples of anti-Communist and anti-Catholic pamphlets and printed
        materials from the 1950s and 1960s, as well as a Pickrick Drumstick autographed by Lester
        Maddox. These drumsticks were wooden pick ax handles were used to threaten Black Georgia
        Tech students seeking to integrate the Pickrick Cafeteria restaurant in Atlanta in 1964, and
        later used as segregationist symbols sold as souvenirs during Maddox's 1966 gubanatorial
        campaign.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>According to U.S. Census and Virginia marriage records, William Hicks McIver was a white
        man born August 13, 1898 in Sanford, North Carolina, to Abigail Chaffin and John Henry
        McIver. He worked as a tobacco foreman in the 1930s and married Marjorie Tice Marshall, then
        a widow, on March 28, 1932. Marjorie was a white woman born July 4, 1898, in Columbus,
        Indiana. </p>
      <p>William served in World War II, but we are not sure in what capacity. The couple lived in
        Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and had no children. William McIver died on January 8, 1979.
        Marjorie died on October 8, 1982, in Durham, North Carolina.</p>
      <p>It has been challenging to learn more about the history of this family. Census research
        confirmed that Mattie McIver, the recipient of many of the postcards held in the collection,
        was William's older sister, who was born in approximately 1893 in Germanton, N.C.</p>

        or holiday cards collected by William McIver's family, largely his sister, Mattie McIver,
        during the 1910s. There is a folder of letters sent to Marjorie McIver from elected
        officials responding to her opinions on pending legislation. Topics include Congressman
        Graham A. Barden's Federal Aid to Education Bill, prayer in public schools, President
        Kennedy's tax proposal, and the Vietnam War. The collection contains examples of
        anti-Communist and anti-Catholic pamphlets and printed materials from the 1950s and 1960s,
        as well as a Pickrick Drumstick autographed by Lester Maddox. These drumsticks were wooden
        pick ax handles were used to threaten Black Georgia Tech students seeking to integrate the

          <p>This item is an example of a Pickrick Drumstick, which were wooden pick ax handles used
            to threaten Black Georgia Tech students and protestors seeking to integrate the Pickrick
            Cafeteria restaurant in Atlanta in 1964, and later adopted by Maddox as a segregationist
            symbol. Maddox sold these drumsticks as souvenirs after closing his restaurant rather
            than agree to integration. This item appears to date from Maddox's gubanatorial campaign
            in 1966. Unknown how the McIvers acquired this item, or when.</p>
