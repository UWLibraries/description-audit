            of John Hendricks Kinyoun (1825-1903), physician and surgeon in the Confederate Army.
            Correspondence between Kinyoun and his wife, Elizabeth A. (Conrad) Kinyoun, during the
            Civil War discusses camp life; the health of the troops; supplies; his work in Winder
            Hospital, Richmond, Virginia; troop movements and military engagements, especially of
            the 28th North Carolina Volunteers and the 66th North Carolina Infantry; the Siege of
            Petersburg; and his views on the Confederacy and its cause. The earliest letter, 1851,
            from Kinyoun while a student in college, describes a meeting of the American
            Colonization Society. There are also letters written to the Kinyouns after they moved to
            Missouri; and a folder of writings which includes a political speech, 1896, by Kinyoun
            criticizing the Cleveland administration and espousing the free silver
            doctrine.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>John Hendricks Kinyoun was a physician, farmer, and Confederate surgeon during the Civil
            War. Born October 4, 1825 in Rowan (now Davie) County, Missouri, he attended Wake Forest
            University, North Carolina for one year, then transferred to Columbian College,
            Washington, DC, then entered Union College in New York. In 1856, he married Elizabeth
            (Bettie) A. Conrad of Forsyth County, North Carolina (d. 1872). While teaching in N.C.,
            Kinyoun attended law school for a time, then began his medical training with Dr.
            Valentine Mott, surgeon at University of the City of New York, graduating from the
            University in medicine in 1859. In 1861, he entered the Confederate service as a
            captain, and participated in many battles. He was then appointed surgeon for the
            duration of the war. After the war, Dr. Kinyoun returned to North Carolina, where he
            took up farming as well as a medical practice. He and his family then moved to the
            village of Centerview, Missouri. He remarried in 1879 to Martha Hammonds. Kinyoun passed
            away in Missouri on July 27, 1903.</p>
