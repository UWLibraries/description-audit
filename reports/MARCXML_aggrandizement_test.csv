Topics include his activities as a lyceum lecturer; his marriages and family relations; his role in and perspective on American politics and foreign relations, particularly during World War II; travels in Europe; and his interest in civic affairs, social reform and race relations in the United States, particularly during and following Reconstruction. In the Correspondence Series, the largest in the collection, letters prior to 1880 include personal correspondence from various members of the Page family, especially between Thomas Nelson Page, his mother, Elizabeth Burwell (Nelson) Page, and brother, Rosewell Page, who lived at the ancestral estate, ""Oakland,"" in Hanover County, Virginia. Another set of correspondence, dated 1883-1912 and interfiled with the rest of the correspondence, comprises photocopies of letters (and other items) chiefly from Page to close friend Henry Wise Hobson (1858-1898), originally of Virginia, and his wife Katherine. Page describes his political activities in letters concerning the presidential campaigns of 1912 and 1916. Correspondence from this period also includes personal letters to members of the family describing new experiences in diplomatic life, and routine business correspondence. Significant correspondents in the series include C. F. Adams, Grover Cleveland, Josephus Daniels, J. C. Harris, William D. Howells, Robert Lansing, Robert T. Lincoln, Henry C. Lodge, Theodore Roosevelt, E. Root, J. M. Stoddart, and William H. Taft. For some of these individuals only one or two pieces of correspondence exist. The collection also includes two scrapbooks, found in the Personal Papers Series, containing cards and envelopes from distinguished persons. This series also houses documents related to Page's ties with the University of Virginia, personal reminiscences, various fragmentary notes, and a journal from 1863. Four folders of carbon copies of diplomatic dispatches from Page to the U.S. State Department and to President Woodrow Wilson, along with other papers related to his diplomatic activities, can be found in the Diplomacy Series. Another small group, the Legal and Financial Series, houses documents relating to Page's properties and other business affairs. The Writings and Speeches Series contains many manuscripts and drafts of political and literary speeches, memoirs, essays, and articles, but none of Page's major literary works. Several folders of materials in this series contain Page's detailed journalistic notes describing his trips in 1916 to the war fronts in Italy and France. Extensive folders of cuttings in the Clippings Series were taken from both American and Italian newspapers, and comprise a significant portion of the collection. The clippings refer to events in Page's career such as lyceum appearances, political appointments, and political speeches, both in the United States and in Italy. In addition, Page clipped articles referring to race relations in the United States, particularly in the South. The clippings also document national and global events during Page's years as an ambassador to Italy from 1913 to 1919, and provide rich background material for a study of United States foreign relations with Italy and other countries during World War I. There are also a few photographs in the Visual Materials Series, some of which depict scenes from wartime Italy."

While letters often mention his father's writing and financial difficulties, they primarily describe a voyage on board the United States brigantine Boxer, part of a slaving squadron. The trip, begun in 1846, included stops at principal slave stations on the west coast of Africa, including Monrovia, Liberia; Ambrize, St. Paul de Loando, and Cabinda, Angola as well as the Congo River. The ship also docked at the Cape Verde Islands; the Canary islands; St. Antonio, Prince's Island; and the U.S. Consulate at Madeira. Parker wrote of hopes both to intercept slave ships at sea and take prize money. He described the superior maneuverability of steam vessels over sailing ships, which allowed steamboats to be more successful in intercepting ships of slave traders. A letter in 1846 describes the miserable conditions of the former slaves who were freed and transported to Liberia by the American Colonization Society. Two letters concern Parker's commission as U.S. Consul for the Cape Verde Islands.

The papers consist chiefly of newsletters, minutes of the Board and other meetings, administrative and financial records, publicity materials, newspaper clippings, and information related to the political work of the League. Most of the papers address the work of the Durham League, which was founded in 1946 and ceased operations in 1991. Scattered records document the activities of the League of Women Voters of North Carolina. The League is best known as a non-partisan organization sponsoring voter registration and candidates' forums, and those activities are well-documented here. In addition, League members held meetings to discuss a broad range of other social and political issues, and from those debates formulated positions which the chapter then lobbied for in the media and through various political channels. The issues discussed in depth and documented in the collection include school desegregation; the merger of the Durham city and county school systems; local bond issues; the Equal Rights Amendment; foreign trade; diplomatic relations between the United States and China; water and air quality; solid and toxic waste; and reproductive rights. The papers include some correspondence with local, state, and federal officials regarding these and other issues; however, correspondence in general comprises a small portion of the collection. The papers document the League activities of various Durham women who became prominent in local and state politics. The papers also provide a window onto racial politics in Durham, in particular through debates over school desegregation and the proposed merger of the city and county school systems. Voter registration materials and correspondence also shed light on this subject, including a few letters the League received condemning its attempts to register supposedly uneducated African Americans."

Letters that Smedley wrote to his wife and children while he was on business trips to the Confederate States (1864) form the bulk of the collection. The miscellany includes a narrative describing his successful attempt to find Lee's headquarters at the time he was engaged in the Petersburg Campaing. Also included is a fragment of Smedley's notes for a speech on secession. Printed materials include military passes, a Manassas Club membership card, and a Spotswood Hotel (Richmond, Va.) menu. Smedley wrote of methods used to conduct his business such as living under an assumed name, and a mission requiring an act of Congress, although it is not clear just what business this was. His work in the Southern States included selling arms to both N.C. and S.C. and his letters reflect meetings with Governors Vance and Bonham. Letters mention the possibility of running a blockade to sell locomotives to the Confederacy and reflect connections with officials such as Judah P. Benjamin, Secretary of State, Gen. William Whiting, and Gen. John C. Breckinridge. Smedley sometimes speaks critically of business associates in England and tells his wife whom they can and cannot trust. His concern for family finances is obvious and he discusses buying Confederate bonds for security. At times, Smedley sent multiple copies of letters to his wife, apparently due to the mail's unreliaibility. It is also obvious that he was being discreet about what to include in the letters for fear that Union agents could intercept them. He describes a perilous journey from Kentucky back to Richmond. One letter describes St. Mary's College in Raleigh, N.C. in detail and Smedley includes a sketch. Apparently his wife went to school there, and Smedley was able to meet the founder, Aldert Smedes. Letters from Wilmington, N.C. and Charleston, S.C. give a good description of life there during the war. Smedley always held great confidence that the South would win the war."

All images are black and white. The core of the collection, the Image Files Series, consists of around 1000 8x10 photographs (""A"" images) of advertising designs, and a similar number of smaller printed cards (approx. 5x7 to 5x8, ""B"" images) of outdoor advertisement designs. The images are accompanied by three different Access Files to be used to browse the collection. These files are in the form of image photocopies ( ""job tickets"" ) and catalog cards. Most images are of poster (billboard or transit card) designs, but there are also some photographs of tabletop display advertising, window cards and other point-of-purchase displays. The collection documents advertising during a time when transportation was changing in America, and the automobile was gaining in popularity. Billboards began to replace smaller posters, accommodating a more mobile public. It was then that Strobridge turned from its emphasis on circus and theater posters (not represented in the collection) to billboard ads for mass-produced products. Many different products are featured, but perhaps the two most prominent and well-represented campaigns are those for Camel cigarettes and Palmolive soaps. The images form a valuable reference collection of advertising designs, relevant for researchers from a variety of disciplines including commercial artwork, advertising history and design, and popular culture. The collection documents outdoor advertising design during the first part of the twentieth century for what were mostly national brands. Numerous examples are from the era of hand-drawn and painted designs, often signed by artists including Norman Rockwell, Howard Scott, and Dr. Seuss (see his designs for the product Flit). Rarely, an artist is listed on the back of the image. Later designs from the 1940s and 1950s include photographic images, often peppered with celebrity likenesses including John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, and Charlton Heston. Many of the celebrity advertisements promoted tobacco products. Some designs are clearly war-era, such as advertisements depicting a 1943 female factory worker, or one from Schlitz (1942) mentioning war bonds."

The Personal Files Series depicts the numerous financial, legal, and medical issues confronted by Peslikis over three decades. Peslikis received assistance in the form of Supplemental Security Income (SSI), food stamps, and subsidized housing for artists (at Westbeth Artist Housing), each of which required meticulous documentation in order to retain. A portion of this series is closed until 2099. The Subject Files Series consists primarily of clippings and notes retained by Peslikis on a number of women- and feminism-related subjects, as well as on art, astrology, United States foreign policy, and Greek politics. The Education Series is composed of files documenting Peslikis as a student, an instructor, and an instructor in search of employment.

Nystrom suggests Reed's role at JWT, recommending to Resor that Reed continue the study of population trends and to apply their meaning to business. This is reflected in materials in the collection, which contains a numerous documents showing the analysis of population trends and the illustration of their influence to the various markets, especially those of the foreign nations. The information was compiled by Reed and later by Smilde and was distributed to the JWT personnel and clients. In a memorandum written by Reed on May 1, 1958 to Robert Berry, for example, Reed provides facts on population trends and his interpretations of them to be included in Norman Strouse's speech (in the New York Office folder in the JWT Office Series). The papers also include market analysis compiled by other JWT offices. For instance, the JWT Office Series contains a report prepared by the Tokyo Office on Japanese dairy product market. Many materials throughout the collection include reference to the World Markets Books, a series prepared and published by JWT. The papers, especially those in the folder titled World Markets Books (1958) in the Subject Files Series, indicate that Reed had an important role for the project. The Series did not see the completion at the time of Reed's retirement. In a letter written to Howard Kohl on April 16, 1958, Reed suggests Smilde to be his successor (in the Correspondence Series). Subsequently, the Smilde papers, dated mostly from 1960, frequently mentions the World Markets books."

It emerged in April of 1960 from student meetings led by Baker and held at Shaw. Some of the original student members were organizers of sit-ins at segregated lunch counters in the southern United States. Its purpose then was to coordinate the use of nonviolent direct action to attack segregation and other forms of racism."

Though short, daily diary entries typically cover a wide range of regular topics, including weather conditions; domestic events, such as family visits, vacations, and medical illnesses, as well as the hiring and firing of staff; and social engagements, such as church attendance, business trips, and evening entertainments, e.g., ""... Mannix came over & I went with him to the Theatre Comique more to see the Indians than the performances"" (1872 Sept. 5). In addition, Offley details daily household and other expenditures; then totals the expenses for each month in tables at the end of each volume. Within each diary's back matter he also outlines other information, including the Tallapoosa railway's running times, cities, and mileage (1872), and the savings bonds purchased for his children (1873). Diary entries become more sporadic beginning in August 1873. Offley also comments on his work in nearly every entry, especially the impact Secretary of the Navy George M. Robeson's presence or absence has on it; and he writes with increasing length on the topic over the two years: ""The Secretary, after delay'g attent'n to his work for a month, sent a basketfull of papers to K.

He also observes activities associated with Grant's second inauguration. Photographs in the collection include a cartes de visite (circa 1873) of Offley's wife, Mary Cleland Nelson Offley.

The centerpiece of the collection is a specimen book of sample cigar box labels, created by the lithographers Heppenheimer & Maurer around 1878. The specimen book includes about 115 leaves, with labels affixed on each side of the leaf; the color ranges from two colors to multiple colors per label. Account books document cigar production, purchase, and sales information. Acquired as part of the John W. Hartman Center for Sales, Advertising & Marketing History. Heppenheimer & Maurer was a lithography company that created box labels for cigar manufacturers to paste on the inside lid of a box of cigars. Sample books like the one in this collection were distributed to local cigar manufacturers, who could then order the labels by their designated number. Frederick Heppenheimer, from New York City, was one of the earliest and most prolific commercial lithographers.

Quaker minister Elizabeth Robson [née Stephenson] was born on 25 June 1771 at Bridlington Quay, Yorkshire, the third of five children of Isaac Stephenson, a master mariner, and his third wife, Elizabeth Stephenson. Both parents were Quakers and she was educated at Ackworth School. On 22 December 1796 she married Thomas Robson, a Darlington linen manufacturer and Quaker Elder. The couple had seven children. In 1810 her vocal ministry was acknowledged by Stockton monthly meeting, as was that of her brother Isaac (1765-1830), a miller at Stockton-on-Tees. Both traveled widely in religious circles in Europe and the United States. Isaac's experience of the 'spirit of Ranterism' of the 'new lights' of Salem and Lynn, Massachusetts, perhaps predisposed Robson on her first American visit (1824-1828) to see similar opposition to good order among the followers of Elias Hicks, whose theology she found objectionable. The Hicksites in turn accused her and other visiting English Friends of responsibility for the 1827-1828 separations which rent American Quakerism for more than a century. Her second extended visit to America (1838-1842), undertaken in company with her husband, was seen as supportive by those among orthodox Philadelphia Quakers who were disturbed by the views of Joseph John Gurney. Significantly, during that visit she showed a more relaxed attitude to the Hicksites."

In December of 1960, she formally hired Francois Duhau de Berenx to help bring it to pass. The Thai House Foundation was established on January 30, 1961, the name was changed to the Foundation for Southeast Asian Art and Culture (SEAAC) in June of that same year. The establishment of the Foundation resulted in a project that Doris Duke saw as a gift to Hawaii, and one that occupied her for many years. At least five sites in Hawaii were considered for the Thai Village and it was the choice of an appropriate location that ultimately proved the stumbling block to completion of the project. Although her dream of a Thai Village was never fulfilled, Doris Duke's interest in Asia continued, as she continued purchasing objects right up until her death in 1993. In 2002, a significant portion of the collection was donated to two museums distinguished for their collections of Southeast Asian art; the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco and the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore."

The letter book (23 April 1771-29 April 1773) recorded Cheston's regular letters to the Stevenson, Randolph & Cheston firm in England, which averaged three to five days apart. The main topics were shipments to and from Baltimore, Md., as well as current prices for incoming and outgoing cargo, including convict servants and products arriving from England; slaves from the West Indies and Africa; and tobacco, corn, wheat requisitioned locally to be sold in England. Upon their arrival, Cheston noted the state of each ship and its passengers. He commented in several letters that recent changes in shipbuilding decreased ventilation below deck; he believed this resulted in more rapid spread of illness or disease aboard, as well as more deaths, and urged a return to former building practices. Several letters go on to document ships that were quarantined as a result of disease and deaths aboard. He also made regular notes of debits and credits to various accounts for the firm, and defended his purchases and business decisions to his partners. The account book (29 March 1784-27 May 1784) documented Cheston's warehouse accounts, including those with the Galloway & Cheston firm he set up with his father-in-law, Samuel Galloway. Entries tracked a wide range of items sold, including rum, corn, butter, and sugar. The license (27 June 1772) was probably drafted on the order of Maryland's governor, and permitted Captain Simon Breffitt (of the ship Elizabeth) to unload cargo and passengers that had been quarantined because typhus aboard had killed 18 servants and the boatswain. In his letter book, Cheston followed the situation, and noted his lobbying for the license. The legal document (14 March 1785) was drafted by George Buck in Devon, Eng., and appointed Cheston his representative in Maryland to handle the debt of Emory Sudder, Joseph Earle, and Thomas Smith. It made clear that the Revolutionary War and interfered with the settlement of the debt. The letter (21 June [1780?]) was written by Cheston to ""Jack"" in reference to local distillery accounts."

The ""Committee for Equal Justice for Mrs. Recy Taylor"" was formed a few weeks later, appealing to the Governor of the State to pressure the County to reopen the case. The local chapter of the NAACP, under the leadership of Edgar D. Nixon, helped organize the push for justice (Rosa Parks was working in the NAACP offices during this time and was active in the case). A second grand jury heard the case in February 1945, but again refused to return an indictment. The committee continued to apply pressure through their membership, local NAACP chapters, labor unions, and prominent citizens, but the case was never brought to trial. Many of the organizers used what they learned in subsequent campaigns for civil rights. Recy Taylor and her family lived on in Abbeville for many years, often intimidated and threatened.

Their joint work focused on a series of experiments showing the likeliness of coordination failures even when incentives guide participants to attempt to coordinate - the aim being to highlight the difficulty of economic coordination. The collection also includes Battalio and Van Huyck's communications with other prominent contributors to experimental economics such as Colin Camerer, Charles Holt, John Kagel, Thomas Palfrey, Ariel Rubinstein, Alvin Roth, Larry Samuelson, and Vernon Smith, among others. The collection also documents Battalio and Van Huyck's roles in the Economic Science Association and Van Huyck's as an editor of Experimental Economics, and their department roles, committee work, and teaching contributions in economics at Texas A & M.

Attracted to anarchism after the Haymarket affair, Goldman became a writer and a renowned lecturer on anarchist philosophy, women's rights, and social issues, attracting crowds of thousands. She and anarchist writer Alexander Berkman, her lover and lifelong friend, planned to assassinate industrialist and financier Henry Clay Frick as an act of propaganda of the deed. Frick survived the attempt on his life in 1892 and Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Goldman was imprisoned several times in the years that followed, for ""inciting to riot"" and illegally distributing information about birth control. In 1906, Goldman founded the anarchist journal Mother Earth. In 1917, Goldman and Berkman were sentenced to two years in jail for conspiring to ""induce persons not to register"" for the newly instated draft. After their release from prison, they were arrested--along with hundreds of others--and deported to Russia. Initially supportive of that country's October Revolution which brought the Bolsheviks to power, Goldman reversed her opinion in the wake of the Kronstadt rebellion and denounced the Soviet Union for its violent repression of independent voices. In 1923, she published a book about her experiences, My Disillusionment in Russia. While living in England, Canada, and France, she wrote an autobiography called Living My Life. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she traveled to Spain to support the anarchist revolution there. She died in Toronto on May 14, 1940, aged 70."

She was a successful writer at a time when women professional writers were an anomaly. Her first book of poems (1773) established her literary reputation in England, and her later essays were compared to Samuel Johnson. Along with her husband, Barbauld ran the boy's school Palgrave Academy for 11 years, during which time she established herself as a writer of children's pedagogical texts, as well as poetry for children. She is credited with establishing children's literature as a legitimate genre, and her editorial works, particularly The British Novelists series, helped establish the British literary canon. Barbauld was an abolitionist and was also against the Napoleonic Wars, two subjects she addressed in her political writing. Both her poetry and her political essays were occasionally subject to harsh contemporary criticism, which eventually caused her to retreat from the public eye. She lived in Stoke Newington from 1802 until her death in 1825. Barbauld's literary legacy was largely forgotten until the rise of feminist literary criticism in the late 20th century, which helped resurrect her place in history. William Allen (1770-1843) was an English Quaker abolitionist, scientist, educator, and philanthropist who was active in various social reform movements of early 19th century England. He was trained as a chemist, and his pharmaceutical company, Allen & Hanburys, grew into one of the UK's largest drug companies. One year after this poem was written, he founded the Newington Academy for Girls, a progressive school in Stoke Newington. Although Barbauld was near the end of her life at the time of this writing, is it evidence that she and Allen maintained at least an epistolatory friendship based on their common interests."

In 1756, he joined the secret network of spies called the Secret du Roi employed by King Louis XV. D'Éon appeared publicly as a man and pursued masculine occupations for 49 years. Then, according to an agreement concluded in 1776 with Louis XV, the Chevalier was required to live as a woman in exchange for a life annuity. D'Eon explained that he had been born female but raised as a male by a father desperate for a son. In August 1777 d'Eon returned to France. Upon presenting himself at Versailles in military uniform, he was promptly ordered to resume female dress. The chevalier's requests to be allowed to don his uniform and to serve in the American Revolutionary War were turned down, and he was refused permission to return to London in 1778 to look after his financial interests after the death of Lord Ferrers. D'Éon settled on his family estates at Tonnerre. After a few months imprisonment at Dijon in 1779 for wearing his uniform in public, he again took up residence at Versailles before being finally allowed to return to England in November 1785. His unpaid landlord in Brewer Street was threatening to sell his library and collections. The Chevalier d'Eon died in England in 1810; and it was discovered that he was really a man."
