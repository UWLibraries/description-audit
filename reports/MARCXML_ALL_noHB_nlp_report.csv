Documents relate to Chappell's personal life and career, both as a student and writer at Duke University, where he studied under well-known creative writing teacher William Blackburn, and as a writer and professor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNC-G). The collection documents the entire length and breadth of Chappell's multifaceted career. Beginning with the years just after he completed his undergraduate studies at Duke and began his first novel at the urging of Hiram Haydn, an editor to whom Blackburn had introduced him, the letters, manuscripts, and notebooks provide insight into Chappell's developing literary career, his academic activities at UNC-G, and his growing involvement with a large network of writers, including a number of his former students. Many prominent American authors, especially Southern ones, are represented in the collection. Among the most frequent correspondents are Kelly Cherry, Grace DiSanto, George Garrett, Marianne Gingher, Dana Gioia, Donald Hall, Heather Ross Miller, Robert Morgan, Eve Shelnutt, and Dabney Stuart. Notebooks, manuscripts, typescripts, proofs, and printed material document the development of Chappell's career across all the genres in which he writes.

The letters indicate that Reed's regiment was often on picket duty, but also provide some descriptions of warfare and the ransacking of plantations. Reed, who was nearly illiterate, provides brief insights into daily camp life in terms of references of illnesses, hunger, not being paid for many months, and life as a soldier in the midst of war. Reed occasionally refers to the reception they received from both whites and blacks in the South. He also writes about fixing railroad supply lines and utilizing surrendered Confederate soldiers to aid in this work. In November 1864, he inquires as to whether African American men are being allowed to vote in the North and indicates that they are in the South.",RaceTerms

In the meantime, Eugeneios approached Ammon at Panopolis and even came to some form of agreement with him with the help of Ammon's friends. Afterwards, however, Eugeneios decided to summon Ammon to Alexandria after all. Now that the wills of Harpokration have been found, Ammon expects to be able to secure all three slaves for himself. The slaves are currently in the custody of the office of the katholikos, a high official in Alexandria. Second frame of glass has the coarse linen cloth that was wrapped around P.Duk.inv. 18 when it was rolled up. Recto has another draft of a petition to the katholikos in Greek (P.Duk.inv. 18 R).",SlaveryTerms

Ammon claims three female Phoenician slaves left by his brother Harpokration, rhetor and panegyrist, in Alexandria with his landlord Konon. According to Aurelius Aetios, Ammon's brother died abroad on a trip through Greece, Rome and Constantinople. Afterwards Eugeneios, an imperial secretary, claimed the three slaves as having no other legal owner and secured the imperial permission to do so at some expense (Serenianus son of Palladios told Ammon). In the meantime Eugeneios found out that Harpokration had a brother in Panopolis and approached Ammon there in person. They even came to some form of agreement with the help of their friends, Paniskos, a former judge in Alexandria, Apollon the poet (Ammon's nephew) and Horion another poet(?). Despite this agreement, Ammon was summoned to Alexandria to appear before the katholikos, a high official. Now that the wills of Harpokration have been found, Ammon expects to be able to secure all three slaves for himself. The slaves are currently in the custody of the office of the katholikos.

The majority of these documents pertain to two members of the Cochrane family: the brothers Admiral Arthur Auckland Leopold Pedro Cochrane and Admiral Ernest Grey Lambton Cochrane. The bulk of the papers deal with three principal subject areas: the naval careers of the brothers; family matters and finances, particularly the finances of their Redcastle Estate in County Donegal, Ireland; and business papers and correspondence relating to the family estates and the Trinidad Lake Asphalt Company, established by Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald, and continued by his son Arthur Auckland Leopold Pedro Cochrane. The collection is particularly rich in documenting the beginnings of the asphalt industry in Trinidad and land-use issues in Ireland during the 19th century. In addition, Ernest Grey Lambton Cochrane was stationed off the coast of West Africa during much of the 1850s and 1860s, and the collection contains a number of documents relating to the British attempts during that time to suppress the African slave trade, an effort in which Ernest Grey Lambton Cochrane was active. The collection is divided into three series, the Family Papers Series, the Ernest Grey Lambton Cochrane Series, and the Trinidad Lake Asphalt Series, each of which are divided into subseries by format.

Collection contains 22 letters from Richard Boucher, a coffee and sugar planter in Manchester, Jamaica, to his friend and business associate James George Crabbe. Topics include business concerns in England, Jamaican climate and crop conditions, the collapse of the Jamaican economy, and the availability of bankrupt sugar plantations. Boucher attempted to raise sheep, cattle, and horses as well as sugar, but was not successful. In a letter dated 1823 Sept., Boucher voiced his fears about the emancipation of slaves. In 1824, he wrote of his concern about the proposed boycott of Caribbean products.

All images are black and white. The core of the collection, the Image Files Series, consists of around 1000 8x10 photographs (""A"" images) of advertising designs, and a similar number of smaller printed cards (approx. 5x7 to 5x8, ""B"" images) of outdoor advertisement designs. The images are accompanied by three different Access Files to be used to browse the collection. These files are in the form of image photocopies ( ""job tickets"" ) and catalog cards. Most images are of poster (billboard or transit card) designs, but there are also some photographs of tabletop display advertising, window cards and other point-of-purchase displays. The collection documents advertising during a time when transportation was changing in America, and the automobile was gaining in popularity. Billboards began to replace smaller posters, accommodating a more mobile public. It was then that Strobridge turned from its emphasis on circus and theater posters (not represented in the collection) to billboard ads for mass-produced products. Many different products are featured, but perhaps the two most prominent and well-represented campaigns are those for Camel cigarettes and Palmolive soaps. The images form a valuable reference collection of advertising designs, relevant for researchers from a variety of disciplines including commercial artwork, advertising history and design, and popular culture. The collection documents outdoor advertising design during the first part of the twentieth century for what were mostly national brands. Numerous examples are from the era of hand-drawn and painted designs, often signed by artists including Norman Rockwell, Howard Scott, and Dr. Seuss (see his designs for the product Flit). Rarely, an artist is listed on the back of the image. Later designs from the 1940s and 1950s include photographic images, often peppered with celebrity likenesses including John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, and Charlton Heston. Many of the celebrity advertisements promoted tobacco products. Some designs are clearly war-era, such as advertisements depicting a 1943 female factory worker, or one from Schlitz (1942) mentioning war bonds.",Aggrandizement

Jarvis also gives accounts of actual combat in which his grandfather was engaged, such as the Battle of Brandywine. The memoir tells of the sale of an African American man and woman to a Staten Island resident, and the subsequent division of the money among all those involved.

Meier's correspondence is largely of a professional nature, and is chiefly concerned with international and development economics. Prominent among his correspondents were Peter Bauer, Gottfried Haberler, W.A. Lewis, Hla Myint, Paul Rosenstein-Rodan, W.W. Rostow, Dudley Seers, H.W. Singer, and Paul Streeten. Many of Meier's major publications are represented in the Writings and Speeches Series. These include ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, EMERGING FROM POVERTY, THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS OF DEVELOPMENT, INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT, LEADING ISSUES IN DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS, PIONEERS IN DEVELOPMENT, and the PROBLEMS series of books. Though there are folders containing materials on conferences Meier attended, by and large the Subject Series contains a great deal of course materials. From his days as a student, there are notes, exams, syllabi, reading lists, and bibliographies from Reed College, Harvard University and the University of Oxford concerning courses taken under Chamberlin, Haberler, Hicks, Leontief, and others. Also, there is material from law courses Meier enrolled in at Yale and Stanford Universities. Among the lecture notes from Williams College, Wesleyan, Yale, and Stanford Universities there are also syllabi, exams, and reading lists representing his tenure as a professor. Of particular note are folders concerning Meier's role in the genesis and growth of the College of Social Studies at Wesleyan University.

Kirby owned a mill, a blacksmith shop, a tavern and inn, apple and peach orchards (the names of many peach and apple varieties are specified), a farm, a stagecoach stop, and a store. All of these activities are represented by entries in the ledger. Kirby sold brandy, vinegar, meal, corn, wheat, fodder, beer, cider, nails, lard, and other farm and store goods, but the accounts do not indicate a general store with a wide range of goods. Kirby's customers paid with goods and labor as well as cash. Many pages of the account book are blank, although two pages were used by Rebecca B. Hicks to sketch a plan of a glower garden surrounding a house. The plan is a rough outline only, and no plants are listed. Loose items found inside the volume include a copy of an undated letter to a stagecoach owner about how stagehouse keepers were to charge drivers and passengers for food. There is also an itemized account, 1796-1899, of the medical services of Dr. Stephen Prentice, for whom there is also an account in the ledger. His services included the treatment of Kirby's slaves.

Also included is a biographical sketch of Jacob completed by his granddaughter, Annabelle Saylor. Edward and Solomon Saylor enlisted in the 36th regiment of the Ohio Volunteer Militia in 1861. Jacob attempted to enlist with his brothers, but an Uncle retreived him from the regiment--he was only fifteen years old. Despite his age, later that year Jacob successfully enlisted in the 53rd Ohio Infantry. All the brothers' letters contain descriptions of camp life, military engagements, reported losses in both armies for battles, hardships, and their desire for furloughs. Jacob's correspondence suggests that he did much more hard marching and fighting than his brothers; however, Edward's letters mention that Solomon was wounded and probably taken prisoner twice. Jacob also writes about the formation of the Tennessee Colored Zouave Regiment, which African Americans were eager to volunteer to join. Jacob eventually served in Sherman's Army, and fought in Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia; Edward and Solomon fought mainly in Virginia and Tennessee.",RaceEuphemisms

The letters shed light on the way the grocery business was conducted, how foodstuffs were shipped, problems of price and food quality, and relationships among dealers and customers. Most customers lived in Georgia, while Beatty's wholesale merchants plied their trade in New York City and Philadelphia. The majority of the food was shipped by steamer, though a few orders were carried by passenger train. Sometimes Beatty or his clients complained of poor quality or rotten food. The writers also frankly discussed prices, often commenting that other grocers charged less for certain items. Though the letters were written in the middle of Reconstruction, most do not mention the Civil War. Only one letter is from Beatty himself, dealing with fruit shipments. Few letters have personal details, but in one, in July 1868, the author offered sympathies for the death of Beatty's wife. The collection also includes a short manuscript titled ""The Product of one man's labour on [a] farm in Southern Georgia,"" written in 1844.

Because of Painter's intellectual interests and research, her papers contain a wealth of information about many topics in American history: biography of African Americans; biography as a literary form; slavery; Reconstruction; the 1870s migration from the South to Kansas; a variety of social reform movements--such as abolition, communism, labor, and women's suffrage--and movers, such as Sojourner Truth and Hosea Hudson; and the history of social conditions and political change in the United States from the early-19th to the mid-20th century, particularly as expressed in race relations, in women's history, and in the South. Painter's papers not only document the content and process of her historiographic inquiry, they also constitute their own, contemporary record of many trends in American culture, especially as regards career and educational choices and opportunities for women and African Americans. Her correspondence with students, colleagues, and longtime friends such as Nellie Y. McKay, her teaching material and academic files, her papers from an array of historians' organizations, and her personal journals each shed their own light on these themes. In sum these documents both outline and detail some of the emerging roles of women and African Americans in American society.

Some of the advertisements feature work from notable artists, such as Norman Rockwell, and photographers like Edward Steichen, Irving Penn, and Baron De Meyer. In addition to the actual advertisements, the files dating from the 1910s to 1950s often contain ""insertion schedules"" that provide the dates and names of the magazines or newspapers in which a given advertisement appeared.

Also, advertisements created for clients that JWT lost prior to the 1940s are less likely to have been saved, although some were microfilmed and are still available in that form. For some JWT clients there are no print advertisements at all in this collection. Among the most extensive files of print advertisements are those for the following JWT clients: Champion Spark Plug, Chesebrough-Ponds, Eastman Kodak (Instamatic, Pocket Instamatic, and Disc cameras, Kodak film), Ford Motor Company (consumer and dealer advertisements), R.T.

Correspondents include Arno Johnson, Samuel Meek, and Norman Strouse. The papers depict Reed, as well as Smilde, as a trained economist leading JWT's Research Department. In a letter to Stanley Resor, written on October 11, 1945 by Paul H. Nystrom, a professor at Columbia University's School of Business, Reed's strength as an economist is mentioned (in the Correspondence Series). Nystrom suggests Reed's role at JWT, recommending to Resor that Reed continue the study of population trends and to apply their meaning to business. This is reflected in materials in the collection, which contains a numerous documents showing the analysis of population trends and the illustration of their influence to the various markets, especially those of the foreign nations. The information was compiled by Reed and later by Smilde and was distributed to the JWT personnel and clients.

The papers also include market analysis compiled by other JWT offices. For instance, the JWT Office Series contains a report prepared by the Tokyo Office on Japanese dairy product market. Many materials throughout the collection include reference to the World Markets Books, a series prepared and published by JWT. The papers, especially those in the folder titled World Markets Books (1958) in the Subject Files Series, indicate that Reed had an important role for the project. The Series did not see the completion at the time of Reed's retirement. In a letter written to Howard Kohl on April 16, 1958, Reed suggests Smilde to be his successor (in the Correspondence Series). Subsequently, the Smilde papers, dated mostly from 1960, frequently mentions the World Markets books.",Aggrandizement

Although no author's name is given, from church appointment records it is almost certain that the minister is John Luke Bray (1871-1938). The sermons were given from 1907 to 1938 in localities in southern Virginia (almost all in Danville, Crewe, South Boston, Richmond, and Norfolk); the earliest sermon (1907) was given in Shawnee, Oklahoma. The minister served for several years in each church, the last sermons of 1936-1938 being given in the Methodist Church in the railroad town of Crewe, Va., a church which possibly also served a Baptist congregation, an arrangement not unusual in rural areas. The sermon notes, typed in red and black and typically two to four pages in length, offer evidence of the typical style of preaching in Methodist churches in the South and sometimes refer to social or economic issues. Each envelope enclosing the sermon text is marked with the title, taken from a Biblical text, and when and where preached; most have multiple dates and locations. Most envelopes are marked in a corner as ""Sermon Notes,"" but some are labeled ""Prayer Meetings,"" with the text inside still labeled by the minister as a sermon. There are also a few miscellaneous items, including newspaper clippings, handwritten notes, and one leaf with an undated hymn with words by A. W. Davis, entitled ""Over the Top With Jesus,"" dedicated to a ""Rev. D. H. Kenney."" Some fragile items have been photocopied. Arranged in two series: Prayer Meetings and Sermons, with the bulk of the sermons housed in the latter group. Within each series, arranged in the order of the books of the Bible. The minister who authored these sermons was undoubtedly a member of the Methodist Church South, and from church appointment records he is almost certainly John Luke Bray. According to Bray's obituary in the Virginia Conference Annual (1938), he was born in 1871 in Gloucester County, Virginia to John and Sarah Luke Bray, and entered the Methodist ministry in the Virginia Conference at the age of 18. He was at Randolph-Macon College for an unspecified period but did not graduate. At some point he was reportedly Superintendent of the Masonic Orphanage in Richmond. He married Pauline Clements of Gloucester, Virginia, early in his career. In 1901 he left for the West, and seems to have been minister of the Methodist Church in Shawnee, Oklahoma (then Indian territory), in 1906. He returned to Virginia in 1907; a year later Taylor University in Indiana had conferred on him the Divinity Degree. Going by the sermons that survive in this collection, by 1911 he was preaching in Virginia. His first appointment may have been in Lambert's Point, Virginia (near Norfolk). He then was appointed to various large congregations in Richmond and the Norfolk area, then migrated to smaller churches in Southern Virginia. He died in 1938, perhaps in Crewe, Virginia, a small community where he held his last appointment, and is buried in Richmond.",RaceTerms

The collection is divided into the Printed Material and Subject Files Series. Beyond the research materials in these series, there are no additional personal papers of Youngers in the collection. The Printed Material Series contains published reports on human rights circulated by a wide variety of organizations working inside and outside Perú. Most of the Perú-based human rights organizations are connected with the Coordinadora de Derechos Humanos (CNDDHH), an umbrella human rights organization based in Lima. Youngers' research files on human rights issues and a subseries of Peruvian and Latin American serial publications complete the Printed Material Series. The Subject Files Series contains files and informal reports of the CNDDHH and associated human rights organizations, most notably the Asociación Pro Derechos Humanos (APRODEH), El Centro de Asesoría Laboral del Perú (CEDAL), and the Instituto Defensa Legal (IDL). Further documentation of human rights abuses by government and rebel factions, drug policy files, papers related to former Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori's security advisor Vladimiro Montesinos, and the Maoist guerrilla group Sendero Luminoso complete the collection. Material in this collection reveals complex linkages between Peruvian government policy and international pressure, and sheds light on some of the violent tactics employed by revolutionary groups as well as agents of the Peruvian government. Further, it chronicles the consequences of those actions, especially for rural and indigenous populations and local human rights advocates. The collection also contains numerous U.S. government documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act which give insight into U.S. diplomacy, military and drug policy, further complicating narratives of the intensely violent latter decades of the twentieth century in Perú. Substantial portions of the collection are in Spanish. Acquired as part of the Archive for Human Rights.

First he reported that he was learning photography and exhibiting in a gallery, but later that year he noted that he expected to work as a carpenter and was planning to marry Mary Bradley, a wife chosen for him by his aunt and uncle. He had purchased part ownership of a trashing machine, and was planning to rent rather than buy land, although he still felt the draw of possibility settling further West. Jacob also noted that he had served in the Union Army for four months, outlined his thoughts regarding the Confederate surrender, and pointed out that he had traveled to Indianapolis to see Abraham Lincoln's body, and was struck by the cost of the coffin. He also reported that a pick pocket had stolen his pocket book and he was suffering from dental problems. Adam's brother, Pleasant H.

He outlined family members serving in the war, some conscripted against their will and now prisoners, and noted that ""Motsingers are all Union."" In May 1865 he wrote of the difficulty of getting mail through army lines and rumors of atrocities carried out by Rebels against North Carolina civilians in their attempts to identify more soldiers, and compared that to Bushwacker activity in Missouri. Adam's nephew, Henry F. Motsinger, wrote in June 1865 that he felt sorry for the Rebels, who have been ""brought low"" and suffered death and changes in social status. He also he noted how the former slaves were faring. Latter letters deal with family land settlements following deaths.

Motsinger, composed several letters in the collection, they record his attempts to attain education and earn a lucrative living, and his indecisiveness about how and where best to do that. First he reported that he was learning photography and exhibiting in a gallery, but later that year he noted that he expected to work as a carpenter and was planning to marry Mary Bradley, a wife chosen for him by his aunt and uncle. He had purchased part ownership of a trashing machine, and was planning to rent rather than buy land, although he still felt the draw of possibility settling further West. Jacob also noted that he had served in the Union Army for four months, outlined his thoughts regarding the Confederate surrender, and pointed out that he had traveled to Indianapolis to see Abraham Lincoln's body, and was struck by the cost of the coffin. He also reported that a pick pocket had stolen his pocket book and he was suffering from dental problems. Adam's brother, Pleasant H. Motsinger, wrote in March 1865 of an 1861 dream that foreshadowed, he felt, destruction of his family home and property in North Carolina. He outlined family members serving in the war, some conscripted against their will and now prisoners, and noted that ""Motsingers are all Union."" In May 1865 he wrote of the difficulty of getting mail through army lines and rumors of atrocities carried out by Rebels against North Carolina civilians in their attempts to identify more soldiers, and compared that to Bushwacker activity in Missouri. Adam's nephew, Henry F. Motsinger, wrote in June 1865 that he felt sorry for the Rebels, who have been ""brought low"" and suffered death and changes in social status. He also he noted how the former slaves were faring. Latter letters deal with family land settlements following deaths. In his account book (36 pages), Henry Franklin Motsinger recorded his slaughtering and other sales, and those who helped in the process; prices obtained for his crops and animals; cost paid him for making and repairing plows, wagons, wheels and fittings; and rents paid.",SlaveryTerms

Quaker minister Elizabeth Robson [née Stephenson] was born on 25 June 1771 at Bridlington Quay, Yorkshire, the third of five children of Isaac Stephenson, a master mariner, and his third wife, Elizabeth Stephenson. Both parents were Quakers and she was educated at Ackworth School. On 22 December 1796 she married Thomas Robson, a Darlington linen manufacturer and Quaker Elder. The couple had seven children. In 1810 her vocal ministry was acknowledged by Stockton monthly meeting, as was that of her brother Isaac (1765-1830), a miller at Stockton-on-Tees. Both traveled widely in religious circles in Europe and the United States. Isaac's experience of the 'spirit of Ranterism' of the 'new lights' of Salem and Lynn, Massachusetts, perhaps predisposed Robson on her first American visit (1824-1828) to see similar opposition to good order among the followers of Elias Hicks, whose theology she found objectionable. The Hicksites in turn accused her and other visiting English Friends of responsibility for the 1827-1828 separations which rent American Quakerism for more than a century.

""Journal of our Tour through Italy in the spring of 1861 [A faithful record of facts, impressions, and memories.] Vol. 1"" kept by an anonymous Englishwoman. Members of the travel party included the author, Ellen Lee-Warner and her daughter, Rosie, cousins Lucy and Harry, a Miss Rosenberg, and the party's travel guide.The author might have been a relative of the Lee-Warner family, but this relationship could not be confirmed. The trip began in Paris, proceeded via train to Marseille, by steamer to Italy, then by coach to Rome. The bulk of the journal focuses on the nine weeks the party spent in Rome, before heading South to Naples and Pompeii. The author was highly educated, and described topography, nature, architecture, weather, artwork, tourist sites, people and social life. The party visited many sculpture studios in Rome, and sculptors Harriet Goodhue Hosmer and John Gibson are mentioned. Of Pompeii the author wrote, ""The half overthrown walls, the disinterred amphitheatres, the ghost like rows of white columns, the lifeless streets, and the priest less temples are all singular memorials of their age, but when its dark story rises before me and the dusty legends of a thousand years old are whispered among its ruins ... it becomes doubly strange in its strong sharply defined contrast to our present habits, & thoughts"" (3 May). Scattered throughout the journal are small (less than 1"" x 1"") albumen photographs of artwork or sites described in the surrounding text. Acquired as part of the William B.

Falmouth on a cruise to the Pacific. McKeever sailed the ship in July 1837 on an exploratory voyage after the United States and Europe recognized the Peru-Bolivian Confederation. Rather than sail around the horn, McKeever unsuccessfully attempted to go through the Strait of Magellan. Includes reports regarding a suspected pirate ship, a duel among crew members, and a British consul's death. In March 1838, the Confederation blockaded the port of Valparaiso and in April, McKeever was asked to deliver to Peru the first news of a treaty between the United States and the Confederation.Throughout 1838 McKeever reported on political developments and military (army and navy troop movements), then noted the Chilean army's defeat of Santa Cruz at the Battle of Yungay in February 1839, along with the defeat of the Bolivian army and Peruvian navy. At that point, merchants from Lima hid their treasure on ships and in castles for fear of invasion. The Confederation dissolved, Santa Cruz was exiled, and peace was lasting. Eventually McKeever returned the ship to the New York Harbor and reported to Secretary of the Navy, J. K. Paulding. Volume 2 (275 pages, 200 letters, dated March 1847-November 1851) was maintained while McKeever served as commander of the New York Navy Yard, Commodore of the Brazil Naval Station in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Captain of the Frigate ""Congress."" Letters show that at the navy yard, McKeever was a scrupulous cost cutter, questioning purchases, contracts, and agreements. He sailed the Congress to Havana to take command of the United States' effort to stop the slave trade, in association with Great Britain and France. He ordered the ""St. Louis"" to be stationed at the Platte River. When he arrived in Cuba, many of his crew were suffering from scurvy. In December 1850, flogging was abolished as a punishment for sailors. Between 1850 and 1851 McKeever describes the civil war which resulted in the overthrow of Argentinian dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas by Justo Jose de Urquiza. Volume 3 (300 pages, about 175 letters, dated 1851-1853) was also written from the Brazil Naval Station and from aboard the frigate Congress during missions to Brazil and Argentina. In lengthy letters, The turmoil resulting from the war between Rosas and Urquiza, involving guerrilla warfare and looting, moved McKeever to send in the United States marines in order to protect the United States' interests. The marines killed looters, quelling the violence. Urquiza, with the backing of Uruguay and Brazil, became the first president of the Argentinian republic. Other topics include punishment. McKeever advocated the use of tattoos to prevent wrongdoers from re-enlisting, and made wide use of court-martials. He also wrote of his serious disagreement with his flag-captain, McIntosh.",SlaveryTerms

The total loss of British men was about 200 out of a force of about 1200. The operation in the Mamund Valley ended in January 1897. Collection comprises glossy black-and-white photographic prints of Afghanistan, taken by an anonymous photographer during the Anglo-Afghan War, most likely in summer and fall 1897. The images consist of 24 8.125"" x 5.75"" prints, and 21 smaller 4.125"" x 5.75"" prints, all affixed to cardstock, three or four per page, often on both sides of the board. There is also a panoramic shot of the Tungai Pass made up of three sequenced prints. Pasted-down typed captions are also present for some images, while others carry handwritten captions; a few are dated 1897. The set was originally housed in an unmarked cloth and board portfolio, which has also been conserved. Resembling to some degree in subject matter the Afghanistan images of military photographer R.

The landscape views include the Mamund Valley, Tangi Pass, Agrah, Chakdara, Malakand, and Ambeyla Pass, and a few captions describe events taking place in that location. Military camps, many taken at a distance with fine detail, include Buner, Inayat Killa, Kindergali, and Malakand. A few scenes show bridges, including a boat bridge over the Indus.

The collection is arranged into five series: Correspondence, Financial Records, Legal Records, Miscellaneous Records, and the Divorce Proceedings of James B. Duke and Lillian McCredy Duke. The collection primarily documents James B. Duke's business and personal activities. The correspondence is a combination of business and personal letters, with many of the personal letters related to his philanthropy, such as requests from individuals for financial aid and other forms of assistance or favors, such as making investments and employment. Financial records include invoices and receipts for his businesses such as the British American Tobacco Company and the Raritan Power Co., and purchases for his Fifth Avenue mansion in New York City, Duke Farms in New Jersey, and other personal belongings such as furniture, clothing, and jewelry purchased by Nanaline Holt Inman Duke. The collection also documents the administration of the Estate of James B. Duke, including legal proceedings stemming from claims made against the estate after the will of James B. Duke had been executed. A quarter of the collection focuses on the divorce of J.B. Duke and his first wife Lillian McCredy Duke, including statements and affidavits of witnesses involved in the divorce proceedings.Miscellaneous records include a booklet tracing the Duke family geneaology and the Duke Name Project including incomplete names of Duke family members.

The Thai House Foundation was established on January 30, 1961, the name was changed to the Foundation for Southeast Asian Art and Culture (SEAAC) in June of that same year. The establishment of the Foundation resulted in a project that Doris Duke saw as a gift to Hawaii, and one that occupied her for many years. At least five sites in Hawaii were considered for the Thai Village and it was the choice of an appropriate location that ultimately proved the stumbling block to completion of the project. Although her dream of a Thai Village was never fulfilled, Doris Duke's interest in Asia continued, as she continued purchasing objects right up until her death in 1993.

The handling of the case aroused concern about racial injustice in the southern judicial system which led to the formation of a national campaign for clemency. Through the efforts of the African American community, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the communist-influenced Civil Rights Congress (CRC), the Ingrams' original death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment in 1948 and eventual release in 1959.

The handling of the case aroused concern about racial injustice in the southern judicial system which led to the formation of a national campaign for clemency. Through the efforts of the African American community, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the communist-influenced Civil Rights Congress (CRC), the Ingrams' original death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment in 1948 and eventual release in 1959. The three items in the collection were published in 1954, when publicity for the case was largely coordinated by the Women's Committee for Equal Justice, an off-shoot of the CRC headed by the civil rights activist, Mary Church Terrell. Although not explicitly dated, two items were clearly issued in early May: A broadside from the Women's Committee for Equal Justice in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and a four page newsletter from the New York headquarters of the Women's Committee for Equal Justice designed to raise support for the May 9th and 10th ""Mother's Day crusade for the freedom of Mrs. Rosa Lee Ingram and her sons."" The earliest item is a four page newsletter published in February 1954 by the Pennsylvania Civil Rights Congress, LET FREEDOM RING, volume 1, number 3.

While he seldom mentioned his medical work, he chronicled treatments for and the deaths of British soldiers and colonials, as well as vaccinations and other aid for Africans. He also noted his visit to a ""lunatic asylum"" and his presence at a tribal circumcision ceremony.

An international event dedicated to the theatrical exhibition of non-fiction cinema, the Festival is held annually for four days in the Spring in downtown Durham, North Carolina. Typically, more than 100 films are screened, along with discussions, panels, and workshops fostering conversation between filmmakers, film professionals and the public. The Full Frame Archive comprises preservation masters of documentary films that won awards at the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival (formerly DoubleTake Film Festival) between 1998 and 2011. Formats include 35mm film, 16mm film, Digital Betacam cassette, HDCAM cassette, Betacam SP cassette, and DVD. In addition, the collection includes programs, t-shirts and other festival ephemera, and promotional materials from various years. While all are documentary films, some may also be considered belonging to the genres of biographical nonfiction, ethnographic, ethnic nonfiction and music. Feature, short and animation forms are all represented. The films vary widely in topic and style, with a predominant emphasis on human rights issues. All of the films deal with social issues in one way or another, including topics such as gender; family relations; education; life cycles (childhood, aging, death, etc.); crime and justice; minority groups and discrimination; public health; humanitarian aid; technology and social life; migration; democracy; economic development; war and conflict; peace and healing; art and society; religion; rehabilitation; etc. Competition for awards has always been international; though the majority of award-winners are from and about the United States, the collection is also notably strong on topics relating to Africa and the Middle East. Only films completed within one year of the festival were eligible for competition, thus all are contemporary to the festival date. The number and type of awards given at the Festival changed from year to year; thus, each year is represented by a different number of films, selected according to varying criteria. The Archive was begun in late 2007 and acquisitions are ongoing. The films are donated by the filmmaker and/or copyright holder. Although the intent is to eventually preserve every Full Frame award winner, this may not be possible, as some copyright holders may decline to donate their work.",RaceTerms

Premiere Edition, avec figure. Dediée a la plus Belle et la plus vertueuse femme de l'univers. ""A Cithere"" [?Paris], 1771. (pp. [ix],6, [6], 109, the final 3 pages blank, including 4 full-page gouache illustrations, and several coloured borders and tailpieces). The manuscript is an unpublished libertine and utopian conte philosophique in the form of an illustrated correspondence, ostensibly between a brother and sister, on the subject of ""La liberté d'aimer"" (freedom to love). The anonymous author, unidentifiable from the initials subscribed to the dedication, follows Voltaire's recently-published LA PRINCESSE DE BABYLONE (1768), by presenting the correspondence as letters home from a young man travelling the world, from Paris, Copenhagen, London, Japan, China, North America, and India, presenting his impressions on their respective customs and beliefs. His interest is in relations between men and women, the pursuit of erotic pleasure (""Volupté"") and varieties of partnerships and marriage. Beginning with an ""Apologia du beaux sex,"" the author sets out his desire to celebrate the perfection of the female sex: ""De tous les êtres, je n'en conoius point de plus parfait que la femme."" He refers to a ""livre infernal"" by Jacques Olivier, presumably the violently anti-feminist ALPHABET DE l'IMPERFECTION ET MALICE DES FEMMES (1617 and frequently reprinted) and declares that where that book was dedicated to the intrinsic badness of women, his Is to be devoted to their good.

Despite admission of guilt by one of the men, who also named the others involved, Henry County's all-white grand jury which convened in October failed to return an indictment. The ""Committee for Equal Justice for Mrs. Recy Taylor"" was formed a few weeks later, appealing to the Governor of the State to pressure the County to reopen the case. The local chapter of the NAACP, under the leadership of Edgar D. Nixon, helped organize the push for justice (Rosa Parks was working in the NAACP offices during this time and was active in the case). A second grand jury heard the case in February 1945, but again refused to return an indictment. The committee continued to apply pressure through their membership, local NAACP chapters, labor unions, and prominent citizens, but the case was never brought to trial. Many of the organizers used what they learned in subsequent campaigns for civil rights. Recy Taylor and her family lived on in Abbeville for many years, often intimidated and threatened.

Wilson and his family of Dubuque, Iowa, from the mid-1850s through the early 1870s. The majority of the collection consists of the family's correspondence. David and his wife, Henrietta, wrote frequent letters during his many absences from Dubuque. Both parties are well-represented in the family's papers. Topics tended to center on the family's finances, personal and family news, and local events. Col. D.S. Wilson's military service during the 1860s was only mentioned in passing, as it related to the family's travels or finances. Later letters from D.S. Wilson's time in San Francisco discuss court cases and business news, and include details on family disputes between David and his brother Samuel M. Wilson, also a lawyer. D.S. Wilson repeatedly wrote about his unhappiness at being separated from his family in San Francisco. He finally returned to Dubuque to practice law there and in Washington, D.C. Other major sources of correspondence are the couple's four children, particularly Henry (called ""Harry"") and Gertrude (called ""Gertie"") Wilson, who spent time at Kenyon College in Ohio and Brooke Hall in Pennsylvania. Henry and Gertrude regularly wrote home to their parents and included news about their activities and classmates. Nearly all of the collection's letters from 1873 and 1874 are directed to Gertie, who was actively courted by several men. Gertrude's suitors between 1870 and 1874 include James S. Donnell (Pittsburgh), John H. Rutherford (Cincinatti), Alonzo E. Wood (Dubuque), James H. Park, Charles Plunkett, and George Brock (Chicago); she eventually married Brock on March 2, 1874. The Wilsons' third child, John, appears to have attended school in Dubuque; letters between him and his classmates are also present in the collection and include many secret messages, codes, and nicknames. ""Johnnie"" was regularly referred to as the Champion Flirt of Iowa. Only a few letters remain for the youngest son, David Jr., nicknamed ""Dada."" The collection includes interesting political and legal documents. A diary kept by Wilson in 1860 records his activities as a state senator in the Iowa General Assembly. Also present are miscellaneous materials from some of D.S. Wilson's court cases, including several from the U.S. District Court of Southern California relating to the case McGarrahan vs. the New Idria Quicksilver Mining Company. Wilson's materials also contain a cipher that appears to relate to that case, including code names for various parties and terms. There is also a 1855 General Land Office certificate for D.S.

He writes intimately about their relationship, and discusses their future, his expectations of her as his wife, his sexual desires, their need for birth control and contraceptives once married, his conversion to Catholicism, and his plans for employment and education following his discharge from the U.S. Navy. Other topics of interest are his activities and Navy life aboard ships, particularly the USS Howard Gilmore, and his various deployments in New York, Florida, and the Pacific. Other items in the collection are three clippings from local newspapers announcing Margaret's deployment as a servicewoman in the Women's Army Corps, dating from August 1944.",GenderTerms

W. Bush following Adler's death in 1990 (also mentioned in the military service records file). A second photograph album has a leather cover stamped with the U.S.S. Biloxi banner and Adler's name. This album (133 pages, 351 black-and-white photographs and snapshots, sizes from 2.5x4-inches to 8x10-inches) comprehensively documents life aboard the ship, during leisure and training periods, along with their assignments in Okinawa, Nagasaki, and Hiroshima. Some photographs duplicate those in the Nagasaki photograph album. Most photographs are accompanied by typed captions. There are three loose letters Adler composed to his parents between 5 and 24 Sept. 1945. Topics include the end of his tour of duty and the ship's assignments in Nagasaki. In addition, there are files containing Adler's military service record (1944-1993), as well as his Veteran's Administration medical file (1983-1992 and undated). Adler developed cancers at the end of his life that were potentially related to his exposure at the atomic bombing sites in 1945.

However, the primary focus of the scrapbook was to hold Leon's telegrams and over 183 letters he wrote to Posy during his service. Leon wrote weekly, sometimes daily, and the letters provide a complete description of his service, including training, leisure activities, excursions, homesickness, and other experiences. They often also touch on Adler Company business matters, and his pride in his wife's operation of the store during his absence. Once Leon joined the crew of the Biloxi, his letters focused on life aboard ship, his duties, description of ports, family matters, then the end of the war, the dropping of the atomic bombs, and his preparations to leave the navy. Printed items include a copy of the book U.S.S. BILOXI, probably published in 1946 and a CRAM'S WAR ALAS, undated, for World War II.

The letters demonstrate that Ransom was well educated, devoted to his family, and well liked by members of his company. In the first letter, dated 8 May 1863, Ransom detailed his participation in the fighting at Chuckatuck and Reed's Ferry, and the Nansemond River on 3 May. He described their light marching before the battle; skirmishes; deaths he considered unnecessary and a crime, because the doctor was too afraid to cross the river to be with the men; Rebel prisoners from Texas who still itched to fight and North Carolina deserters who were conscripts and refused to do so; and mud too deep to wade in. Also, the men caused a false alarm of attack by pillaging and shooting pigs, and he suffered swelling because of mosquito bites. During their light march, he described their passing through a Virginia town, where all the women either glared at him or cried, ""I could not help but pity them, though I know they were strong secesh"" (p. 6). He wrote his second letter, dated 14 November 1863, while ensconced in new, brick, quarters in a former store near the shipyard, ferry, and rail road terminus. Their duties at that time involved searching at night for blockade runners in any form. He noted that they still lived on their rations, because not all members of the company would agree to pay 50-75 cents extra per week so that they could live well. He described sharing boxes of food and other goods from home and counted his blessings when he compared his current situation to a year before, when he was living in flooded and muddy camps outside of Fredericksburg.

The 50-pages manuscript contains a manuscript record of undated correspondence between a Monsieur Lucas and Monsieur de la Motte, almost certainly Guillaume Mauquest de la Motte. The record provides the details of a particularly exotic case of extra-uterine pregnancy and the accompanying difficulties, along with treatment and an attempt at surgical remedy. The balance of the volume comprised of the 682-page quarto manuscript written in three different hands with occasional marginal notes, ""Med[icale] pratique-- Chirurgie Medic[cale]: Cahiers sur les Accouchements et les Maladies des Femmes en Couche."" It is a series of instructional lectures that detail all kinds of obstetrical problems and their remedies or management. The text can be broadly defined as dealing with pregnancy and then with women and newborn children, with the emphasis (judging by subjects and amount of the text ) on the former. There are occasional references to the literature of the period, e.g., the specific citation to volume two written by Andre Levret (1703-1780) on p. 447; also occasional citations and references to the Royal Academy of Surgery, e.g., p. 454. The bulk of the text is given over to practical application, i.e., case studies with statements of diagnosis and remedies. These are detailed expositions. There are occasional recipes or formulas recorded for medicines. Attribution of these lectures is assisted by a manuscript notation, in a different and somewhat later hand, immediately beneath the title. There the unknown contemporary interlocutor records in French: ""There is reason to believe that these fascicles [notes?] are those of M. P[obliterated] or at least that they were written under his dictation and that they are the results of his lectures.

Mr. P. is most likely Nicolas Puzos (1686-1753), who served briefly as a military surgeon and became the protégé of Royal Physician and ""Accoucheur"" Julien Clement (1650-1729). Puzos quickly advanced. He was appointed to the Royal Academy of Surgery in 1741, was its director by 1745, and held appointments to the household of Louis XV. This manuscript appears to parallel the order of text in Puzos' posthumously published work on obstetrics [Traite des Accouchements, 1759], but the two are entirely different in content.

SNCC grew into a large organization with many supporters in the North who helped raise funds to support SNCC's work in the South, allowing full-time SNCC workers to have a $10 per week salary. Many unpaid volunteers also worked with SNCC on projects in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, and Maryland. SNCC played a major role in the sit-ins and freedom rides, a leading role in the 1963 March on Washington, Mississippi Freedom Summer, and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party over the next few years.

She played a pivotal role in the development of anarchist political philosophy in North America and Europe in the first half of the 20th century. Born in Kovno, Russian Empire (present-day Kaunas, Lithuania) to a Jewish family, Goldman emigrated to the United States in 1885. Attracted to anarchism after the Haymarket affair, Goldman became a writer and a renowned lecturer on anarchist philosophy, women's rights, and social issues, attracting crowds of thousands. She and anarchist writer Alexander Berkman, her lover and lifelong friend, planned to assassinate industrialist and financier Henry Clay Frick as an act of propaganda of the deed. Frick survived the attempt on his life in 1892 and Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Goldman was imprisoned several times in the years that followed, for ""inciting to riot"" and illegally distributing information about birth control. In 1906, Goldman founded the anarchist journal Mother Earth. In 1917, Goldman and Berkman were sentenced to two years in jail for conspiring to ""induce persons not to register"" for the newly instated draft. After their release from prison, they were arrested--along with hundreds of others--and deported to Russia. Initially supportive of that country's October Revolution which brought the Bolsheviks to power, Goldman reversed her opinion in the wake of the Kronstadt rebellion and denounced the Soviet Union for its violent repression of independent voices. In 1923, she published a book about her experiences, My Disillusionment in Russia. While living in England, Canada, and France, she wrote an autobiography called Living My Life. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she traveled to Spain to support the anarchist revolution there. She died in Toronto on May 14, 1940, aged 70.",Aggrandizement

At the age of 64, Southcott announced she would give birth to a divine child named Shiloh in October 1814. Southcott died not long after, followers claim in childbirth. Her followers, referred to as Southcottians, are said to have numbered over 100,000 but declined by the end of the nineteenth century. Southcott left a sealed wooden box of prophecies with the instruction that it be opened only at a time of national crisis, and then only in the presence of all 24 bishops of the Church of England. An advertising campaign on billboards and in Britsh national newpapers ran in the 1960s and 1970s by one prominent group of Southcottians - the Panacea Society - tried to persuade the 24 bishops to have the box opened.

The last portion of the ledger (approximately 53 pages) contains Snare's records regarding his examinations of soldiers, primarily from Pennsylvania regiments, who had been discharged for various injuries and diseases from both the Civil and Mexican wars. One soldier was from New York, one from Illinois, and one was an African American with the 32nd Regt. U.S. Colored Troops. Entries recorded the soldier's name, home town, regiment and immediate commanding officer, as well as the attorney representing the soldier in his petition. Sometimes the battle in which the injury was received is mentioned, including Antietam, Gettysburg, and Cold Harbor; other notes mention men who were captured and sent to Confederate prisons, including Andersonville. Snare then provided a detailed medical description of the injury or wound and any resulting damage. Several of the men had contracted diseases while on duty, such as typhoid or tuberculosis, had sustained hernias or were sidelined by rheumatism, but most of the men suffered gunshot wounds or injuries from cannon fire. In the margins Snare recorded his estimates for awarding a pension, according to guidelines set by the Pension Office. Some of the soldiers were examined annually or biennially over the course of three years, to reassess their continued eligibility. The ledger was initially used (118 pages) to record transactions for a mercantile business belonging to another Edmund Snare, presumably a relative of Dr. Snare. This Edmund Snare of Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, and New York, sold goods such as coffee, flour, wine, tea, dried fruit, and Cuban tobacco, among other items, and purchased goods from a variety of firms.

Upon presenting himself at Versailles in military uniform, he was promptly ordered to resume female dress.
